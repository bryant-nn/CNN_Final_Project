630cf1b940e337e60fce0385,老師上課會等同學理解後再接續下去，讓同學有足夠時間消化，課程內也舉很多實際案件，讓學習內容更生活化，報告製作過程也讓我們充分了解上課內容，並學習運用自己所學領域製作，很實務的一堂課👍🏻,"The teacher will wait for the students to understand before continuing in class, so that the students have enough time to digest. There are also many practical cases in the course to make the learning content more life-like. The report making process also allows us to fully understand the class content and learn to apply what we have learned. Field production, a very practical class👍🏻",806,89,0,3,0.9959369897842407
630cf1b840e337e60fce02c6,遠距效果很差，全面遠距後可以考慮非同步遠距或是直接停課，不然每次上線我也不知道學了甚麼。期末改成心得的方式對體育學校幫助有點少,"The long-distance effect is very poor. After full distance, you can consider asynchronous long-distance or directly suspend classes, otherwise I don’t know what I have learned every time I go online. At the end of the term, the way of changing it into experience is a bit less helpful to the physical education school",113,77,0,1,0.00023251771926879883

630cf1b840e337e60fce02e7,老師教學認真，內容是有系統且鉅細靡遺，是經驗豐富的老師。希望老師能多傾聽學生的問題，老師似乎不太關注這部分。,"The teacher teaches seriously, the content is systematic and detailed, and he is an experienced teacher.

630cf1b940e337e60fce0451,排球雖然不是我擅長的項目，但是每次上完課之後我都感覺我自己的排球的實力在進步。老師的教學非常容易理解，而且老師也非常願意個別協助像我這種肢體不協調的學生，雖然不擅長，但是多虧老師的耐心教導，我感覺自己越來越喜歡排球。,"Although volleyball is not an item I am good at, I feel that my own volleyball strength is improving after every class. The teacher's teaching is very easy to understand, and the teacher is also very willing to individually assist students like me who are physically uncoordinated.

630cf1b940e337e60fce035e,這堂課的優點： 1.接觸多個所得稅議題：課程設計上，會讓同學針對數個所得稅議題（比如扣除額的存廢、擴大書審制度）進行線上發言，讓同學從理論及實務的角度評析，這使得同學對這些議題更加熟悉。 2.周老師是很和善的一位師長，很願意在課程中及課後與同學進行互動 非常感謝老師本學期的教導，也推薦有興趣的同學修這門課。,"Advantages of this class: 1. Exposure to multiple income tax issues: In terms of course design, students will be allowed to make online speeches on several income tax issues (such as the storage and abolition of deductions, and the expansion of the book review system), allowing students to learn from theoretical and practical aspects. This makes students more familiar with these issues. 2. Teacher Zhou is a very kind teacher who is willing to interact with students during and after class. I am very grateful to the teacher for teaching this semester, and I also recommend interested students to take this course.",751,90,0,1,0.9991015195846558
630cf1b940e337e60fce037f,老師講得很清楚，課堂也會請很多講師來補充更多實務觀念，收穫非常多!,"The teacher explained it very clearly, and many lecturers will be invited to add more practical concepts in the classroom, and I have gained a lot!",806,89,0,3,0.9996362924575806

630cf1b940e337e60fce0345,有提供教學錄影讓學生能自由選擇上課時間。也許是因為我太笨，總覺得老師教得不太好理解，但老師也很體貼像我這樣的笨學生，不會出作業刁難，沒有小考，期中期末也很溫柔。,"Teaching videos are provided so that students can freely choose the class time. Maybe it's because I'm too stupid, I always feel that the teacher's teaching is not very easy to understand, but the teacher is also very considerate to a stupid student like me, he won't make things difficult for him with homework, there are no quizzes, and he is very gentle at the end of the midterm and the end of the semester.",792,93,0,1,0.9876762628555298
630cf1b940e337e60fce0403,時事分享不但可以認識國際上的大小事，也可以練到日文，期末的兩次日文報告也練到了閱讀與口說，雖然準備耗時但很有收穫，感覺有提高我對於日文學習的動力，謝謝老師這學期的指導。,"The sharing of current affairs not only allowed me to understand international events, but also practiced Japanese. The two Japanese reports at the end of the semester also practiced reading and speaking. Although the preparation was time-consuming, it was very rewarding. I feel that it has improved my motivation for learning Japanese. Thank you teacher for your guidance this semester.",70,101,2,1,0.9997373223304749
630cf1b940e337e60fce044a,喜歡雅婷的排球課，和同伴練習有任何問題都可以馬上找老師詢問，課後有問題老師也都會很耐心的回答～,"I like Yating's volleyball class. If you have any questions about practicing with your peers, you can ask the teacher immediately. After class, the teacher will answer patiently~",138,98,0,1,0.9987413287162781
630cf1b840e337e60fce020b,老師上課十分認真，對於觀念的講解也很注重，是一堂可以真的好好學習統計的課，但儘管老師解釋過很多次了，我還是覺得考試時間需要延長，或是減少題目數量，我認為考試的目的在於讓學生確定自己是否吸收了知識，但考試時間太緊湊，基本上沒有時間思考，看到題目必須馬上動筆，否則會寫不完，這似乎會失去考試最一開始的意義，希望老師可以再思考一下。,"The teacher is very serious in class and pays great attention to the explanation of concepts. It is a class where you can really study statistics well. But even though the teacher has explained it many times, I still think that the exam time needs to be extended or the number of questions should be reduced. I think the exam The purpose is to allow students to determine whether they have absorbed the knowledge, but the test time is too tight, there is basically no time to think, and you must start writing immediately when you see the topic, otherwise you will not be able to finish it. This seems to lose the meaning of the test at the beginning. I hope the teacher It's okay to think again.",792,66,0,1,0.0014224052429199219

630cf1b940e337e60fce03af,老師上課講解的部分聽不太懂，建議可以將上課影片錄影上傳到wm5平台上，這樣學生們再回家寫作業或是考試前預習時，針對上課可能吸收的沒有那麼完整的部分或是不太了解的部分，可以再進行二次吸收。,"I don’t quite understand what the teacher explained in class. It is suggested that you can upload the class videos to the wm5 platform, so that when students go home to do their homework or preview before the exam, they may not be able to absorb the incomplete part or the incomplete part of the class.

630cf1b940e337e60fce03b5,因為課程內容很複雜，所以希望老師能上傳課程錄影檔，以利課後重聽複習；尤其因為課程當中涉及了非常多統計相關的內容，對於還沒修過的人來說，非常難以在當下就理解。,"Because the content of the course is very complicated, I hope the teacher can upload the video file of the course to facilitate the review after class; especially because the course involves a lot of statistics-related content, it is very difficult for those who have not taken it before. just understand.",678,87,0,1,0.0013052821159362793

630cf1ba40e337e60fce045e,希望老師選用教材及平台的時候能夠慎選，在某些章節教授的並非購買教材的內容，有點沒東西讀，身邊很認真上課的同學也說看不懂該章講義。,"I hope that teachers can choose carefully when choosing textbooks and platforms. In some chapters, what is taught is not the content of purchased textbooks.",764,686,0,1,0.0067937374114990234

630cf1b940e337e60fce03d3,很多時候都只有簡單帶過，可能老師以為我們應該已經知道了還是怎樣，不過實際上我們根本就無法理解，要考試了還是覺得很抽象（像commit read write那一部分 當然還有其他地方）然後雖然課程是連貫性的沒錯，不過期末考感覺沒有必要連期中的範圍也一起考⋯⋯期末真的很重很多事情，這堂課的loading有點太大了，就算是必修但還是讓人喘不太過氣。另外研究教室的麥克風不能離音響太近也不能對準到它，不然會一直發出干涉的聲音，非常不舒服,"Most of the time, it’s just a simple introduction. Maybe the teacher thought we should already know it or something, but in fact we can’t understand it at all. It’s still very abstract when we have to take the exam (like the part of commit read write, of course there are other places) and although It’s true that the courses are coherent, but I don’t think it’s necessary to take the midterm exam together with the final exam. The final exam is really heavy on a lot of things. The loading of this class is a bit too big. Even if it’s compulsory, it’s still breathless Passed. In addition, the microphone in the research classroom should not be too close to the speaker or aimed at it, otherwise it will always make interference sounds, which is very uncomfortable",803,94,0,1,0.0008659958839416504

630cf1b840e337e60fce02e9,上課進度太快,Class progress too fast,113,77,0,1,0.008523762226104736
630cf1b940e337e60fce0316,覺得老師會將中英文的課程錄影都上傳，對於課後複習的幫助真的非常大。,"I think the teacher will upload both Chinese and English class videos, which is really helpful for after-class review.",803,94,3,1,0.7650580406188965
630cf1b940e337e60fce0348,實體課蠻親近的~,The physical class is quite close~,792,93,0,1,0.9986245632171631
630cf1b840e337e60fce02db,老師很認真也很尊重學生想法，上課內容很有趣，每次上完都對身體有更深的認識，可惜後來轉為全線上，老師辛苦了～,"The teacher is very serious and respects the students' ideas. The content of the class is very interesting. Every time I finish the class, I have a deeper understanding of the body. It is a pity that it has been switched to full online. The teacher has worked hard~",121,80,0,1,0.9932807087898254
630cf1b940e337e60fce034a,講解題目的時候可以清楚一些、慢一些,"When explaining the topic, you can be clearer and slower",792,93,0,1,0.002501189708709717

630cf1b940e337e60fce0426,老師人很好，超可愛的，不過希望可以增加文法講解或課文中的文法解釋延伸，上課可能有一半的時間都在等別人的回答或是造句，能學的東西比較有限。,"The teacher is very nice and super cute, but I hope to add grammar explanations or extensions of grammar explanations in the text, maybe half of the time in class is waiting for others' answers or making sentences, and there are limited things to learn.",146,100,2,3,0.004507660865783691
630cf1b940e337e60fce0418,最後線上考試的內容和實際課堂內容有不小落差(雖然跟遠距也有關係，能感覺老師有想努力克服)但若能考量學生對進攻等比較有難度的內容，較難掌握，可能可以更好一點,"In the end, there is a big gap between the content of the online test and the actual classroom content (although it is also related to the distance, and I can feel that the teacher is trying to overcome it), but if you can consider that students are more difficult to master content such as offense, you may be able to improve it. better",138,98,0,1,0.003379344940185547
630cf1ba40e337e60fce0456,謝謝老師非常用心準備的講義，能感受到老師想讓我們學好初會的努力與付出！您辛苦了～,Thank you teacher for preparing the handouts very carefully. I can feel the teacher's hard work and dedication in wanting us to learn the first meeting well! You worked hard~,764,686,0,1,0.999659538269043

630cf1b840e337e60fce01da,這學期的課程因為時間的關係，很多內容必須跳過或很快帶過，自己需要花比較多時間讀書，不然很容易沒學到東西或跟不上進度，考試也不好準備,"Due to time constraints, many courses in this semester have to be skipped or taken over quickly. I need to spend more time on reading, otherwise it is easy to fail to learn or keep up with the progress, and it is difficult to prepare for the exam.",800,73,0,1,0.00035691261291503906
630cf1b840e337e60fce026b,我覺得老師講課其實很有趣，會讓人想一直聽,I think the teacher's lectures are actually very interesting and make people want to listen to them all the time.,814,72,0,3,0.9988734126091003

630cf1b940e337e60fce03b4,老師上課認真，越到後面東西越難，快撐不住了......,"The teacher is serious in class, and things get harder as you go to the back, and you can't hold it anymore...",678,87,0,1,0.08006829023361206

630cf1b940e337e60fce03dd,老師教學很用心，善於鼓勵同學發言；老師傳遞給同學對於人生和財務得價值觀，是一生受用的。,The teacher is very attentive in teaching and is good at encouraging students to speak; the value of life and finance that the teacher passes on to the students will be useful for a lifetime.,802,685,0,3,0.9997422099113464
630cf1b840e337e60fce02ea,以初級來說教這麼多攻擊有點太難了( ；´Д｀),It's a bit too difficult to teach so many attacks for beginners ( ;´Д｀),113,77,0,1,0.00021320581436157227
630cf1b840e337e60fce02be,老師人很好也很細心，但也有可能是因為太細心了，一點很小很小的事情老師都會叮嚀很久 這學期也因為遠距加上很多變故導致後半學期沒上到什麼課🥲有點可惜,"The teacher is very nice and caring, but it may also be because she is too careful. The teacher will remind me for a long time about even the smallest things. In this semester, due to the distance and many changes, I didn’t have any classes in the second half of the semester. It’s a pity.",808,80,0,1,0.03205132484436035
630cf1b840e337e60fce02e3,雖然是中級但不會很難 而且老師人好給分大方～ 讚讚,"Although it is an intermediate level, it will not be difficult, and the teacher is so kind and generous~ Praise",115,77,0,1,0.9998549222946167
630cf1b940e337e60fce0358,感謝老師提供線上非同步影片，不過希望部分章節的教學速度能夠放慢，以多種方式解釋較艱澀的觀念,"Thanks to the teacher for providing online asynchronous videos, but I hope that the teaching speed of some chapters can be slowed down, and more difficult concepts can be explained in multiple ways",792,93,0,1,0.0023676156997680664
630cf1b940e337e60fce034f,除了統計學所學知識外，期末的程式專案也蠻有趣的,"In addition to the knowledge learned in statistics, the programming project at the end of the term is also quite interesting",792,93,0,1,0.9992706179618835
630cf1b840e337e60fce02d9,很喜歡這堂課，也很喜歡老師上課的氛圍！ 覺得是我在很有作業考試活動壓力的這學期幫助我紓解壓力以及調整身心狀態的一堂課！,"I really like this class, and I also like the atmosphere of the teacher's class! I think it is a class that helped me relieve stress and adjust my physical and mental state during the semester when I was very stressed with homework and exam activities!",121,80,0,1,0.9994612336158752
630cf1b940e337e60fce0311,最用心的教授，沒有之一 特別強調一下，正課的內容比 ta 課豐富很多,"The most attentive professor, none of them. I would like to emphasize that the content of the main class is much richer than that of the TA class.",803,94,3,1,0.9905005097389221
630cf1b840e337e60fce02f7,希望遠距也能像實體一樣提供表格或是統整圖(PDF的註記有點零散),I hope that the distance can also provide a table or a unified map like an entity (the annotations in the PDF are a bit scattered),804,79,0,2,0.00029283761978149414
630cf1b940e337e60fce0445,雅婷超棒 大家都來修,"Yating is awesome, everyone is here to fix it",138,98,0,1,0.999765932559967
630cf1ba40e337e60fce0463,教學內容清晰，但建議講課時候，可以更清晰說明,"The teaching content is clear, but it is recommended to explain more clearly during the lecture",764,686,0,1,0.9366844892501831
630cf1b940e337e60fce0417,謝謝雅婷老師認真又有趣的教學～～ 讓我們上課練基本功＋打比賽很好玩,"Thank you, Teacher Yating, for your serious and interesting teaching~~ Let us practice basic skills in class + play games is fun",138,98,0,1,0.9998577833175659
630cf1b940e337e60fce041a,老師真的好讚，除了每次上課都很認真，課後決定小組收球網的方式多很特別、有趣。,"The teacher is really good. In addition to being serious in every class, there are many special and interesting ways to decide the group to collect the net after class.",142,98,0,1,0.9998657703399658
630cf1b940e337e60fce041c,老師上課真的很用心！雖然因為疫情的關係，下半學期沒有辦法實體進行，但是看得出來老師還是很認真的準備了教材。有點可惜因為線上課沒辦法打球，但希望之後如果有機會，能夠再修到老師的課！,"The teacher is really attentive in class! Although due to the epidemic situation, there is no way to carry out the second half of the semester, it can be seen that the teacher has prepared the teaching materials seriously. It's a pity that I can't play basketball because of the online class, but I hope that if I have the opportunity in the future, I can take the teacher's class again!",142,98,0,1,0.9868118166923523

630cf1b940e337e60fce0413,很可惜遠距後不能實體學習排球技能 但可以看出老師的用心！下次有機會會再選中級,"It's a pity that I can't learn volleyball skills after a long distance, but I can see the teacher's intentions! Next time I have a chance, I will choose another level",138,98,0,1,0.9976052045822144

630cf1ba40e337e60fce0494,一直重複循環類似的部分，從目標體系開始內容都差不了太多，範圍限縮很多，難以發揮。 助教拿做那個爛模型的經費來威脅同學真的不行，教室外面地板的噴漆又不是所有人都有用，而且我們這組用的都清乾淨了，憑甚麼拿不到經費，請改正這樣的態度可以嗎?,"The similar parts are repeated all the time, starting from the target system, the content is not too different, and the scope is greatly reduced, making it difficult to play. It’s really not good for the teaching assistant to threaten the students with the funds for making that bad model. The spray paint on the floor outside the classroom is not useful to everyone, and our group uses it cleanly. Why can’t we get the funds? Please correct this attitude is it okay?",475,106,0,1,0.0002967715263366699
630cf1ba40e337e60fce047d,課程很棒，聽到很多演講！謝謝老師！,"The classes were great and heard a lot of presentations! Thank you, teacher!",816,106,0,3,0.9998711347579956

630cf1b940e337e60fce0414,老師人很幽默也很可愛，會帶著大家從零開始慢慢學習排球，就算真的很爛她也會很有耐心把你教到會，讓一直恐懼球類運動的我增加了很多信心，也開始感覺到排球的樂趣，想跟老師說真的很喜歡妳的排球課！,"The teacher is very humorous and cute. She will take everyone to learn volleyball slowly from scratch. Even if it is really bad, she will teach you patiently. I also started to feel the fun of volleyball, and I want to tell the teacher that I really like your volleyball class!",138,98,0,1,0.9997311234474182
630cf1ba40e337e60fce0469,在這門課中學到了一些都市設計的基礎理論與思維，也獲得許多學習材料。課堂上的創意作業很有趣，只是希望老師可以給我們更多時間去完成。建議的部分，上課經常超時或講不完進度，期中、期末的報告上課時間也超時，希望老師可以更有效掌握時間。另外，也希望課程內容除了理論與經典，可以增加實務面的內容，或是與我們生活相關的內容，讓我們的學習更有感觸，也能從生活中思考。,"In this course, I learned some basic theories and thinking of urban design, and also obtained a lot of learning materials. The creative homework in the class is very interesting, I just hope the teacher can give us more time to complete it. For the part of the suggestion, the class is often overtime or the progress cannot be completed, and the class time for the midterm and final reports is also overtime. I hope the teacher can manage the time more effectively. In addition, I also hope that in addition to theories and classics, the course content can add practical content, or content related to our life, so that our learning will be more touching and we can think from life.",812,106,3,3,0.9907605648040771
630cf1b940e337e60fce0453,雅婷人超好，上課練習滿充足的，而且練習遇到問題她都會很有耐心的指導，下課前還會有健康知識相關補充，而且都會提早下課不會拖到時間,"Yating is super nice, she has plenty of exercises in class, and she will patiently guide you when you encounter problems in practice, and she will provide supplementary health knowledge before class ends, and she will end class early so that it will not be delayed",138,98,0,1,0.9996578693389893
630cf1ba40e337e60fce04b6,上課的內容也很有趣，會先講歷史再講政黨、國會的發展！課前閱讀蠻多，但主要看完中文部分就可以很清楚，之後再慢慢看英文文獻也可以～ 老師也超級可愛！每次到教室都會跟大家說早安>,"The content of the class is also very interesting. I will first talk about history and then talk about the development of political parties and Congress! There is a lot of reading before class, but after reading the Chinese part, you can be very clear, and then you can read the English literature slowly~ The teacher is also super cute! Every time I come to the classroom, I will say good morning to everyone>",815,107,0,3,0.9997023940086365
630cf1b940e337e60fce0447,老師人很好，講解的也非常清楚。如果有不會的地方可以個別詢問，本來不清楚的動作一下子就懂了！上課節奏很棒，不會太累也不會無聊，下課前還會補充一些實用的小知識，每堂課都令我受益良多！,"The teacher is very nice and explains very clearly. If there is something you don't know, you can ask individually, and the movements that were not clear at first will be understood at once! The rhythm of the class is very good, not too tiring or boring, and some practical knowledge will be added before class, every class has benefited me a lot!",138,98,0,1,0.9996989965438843
630cf1ba40e337e60fce045b,期中考試甚難，但老師調整分數的要求卻十分苛刻。許多時候都會無預警的通知而非事先提醒，如第四次小考的延期，5/31日的上課。,"The midterm exam is very difficult, but the teacher's requirements for adjusting the scores are very strict. In many cases, there will be no warning notices instead of advance reminders, such as the postponement of the fourth quiz and the class on 5/31.",764,686,0,1,0.08251947164535522
630cf1b940e337e60fce0452,老師都很鼓勵大家 超棒的！只是後來遠距真的好可惜,The teachers are very encouraging and awesome! It's just a pity that the long distance later,138,98,0,1,0.9982789754867554

630cf1b940e337e60fce0416,麥克風的聲音有時不清楚，但還是很喜歡老師活潑的上課方式,"The sound of the microphone is sometimes not clear, but I still like the teacher's lively way of teaching",138,98,0,1,0.9996343851089478
630cf1ba40e337e60fce0466,很棒很棒,great great,817,105,0,3,0.9998733997344971
630cf1ba40e337e60fce047c,希望下學期一樣能邀請各縣市首長來演講 在QA時希望每場次可以讓不同的同學都有機會發問,I hope that the heads of counties and cities will be invited to give speeches in the next semester. I hope that each session will allow different students to have the opportunity to ask questions.,816,106,0,3,0.99928218126297
630cf1b940e337e60fce0446,感覺光上課練習還是學不會 很多動作還是覺得好難,I feel that I still can’t learn many movements just by practicing in class. I still find it difficult,138,98,0,1,0.0018295049667358398
630cf1ba40e337e60fce0464,中英講義應統一，因為看英文的還是比較習慣（有時候中文講會計很容易腦子打結），有些涉及中會的內容對初會學生太難，應調整。,"The Chinese and English handouts should be unified, because people who read English are more used to it (sometimes it is easy to get confused when speaking Chinese accounting), and some content related to the Presbytery is too difficult for beginners, so it should be adjusted.",764,686,0,1,0.004176497459411621
630cf1ba40e337e60fce045f,學不到什麼東西的課 老師教學沒有系統很難理解 考試又很難 跟小考差別很大 與助教沒有統一教材的感覺,Classes where you can’t learn anything. The teacher’s teaching is not systematic and difficult to understand. The exam is also difficult. It is very different from the quiz. There is no sense of unified teaching materials with the teaching assistants.,764,686,0,1,0.0038314461708068848
630cf1ba40e337e60fce0498,若之後還需要模型製作，希望老師可以多花一點時間在模型製作方法與技巧的教學上，不要只花一節課就帶過，且可以早一點就開始教學讓我們早一點開始製作，因為一兩個月（甚至後來還遠距）對於完全沒有任何模型基礎的學生來說真的來不及，也完全不知道該怎麼做，只能看學長姐的東西依樣畫葫蘆，在課堂上沒有學到什麼有幫助的模型相關知識。,"If model making is still needed in the future, I hope that the teacher can spend more time on the teaching of model making methods and skills. Don’t just take one class and start teaching earlier.

630cf1ba40e337e60fce0491,老師雖然個性幽默、上課方式輕鬆，但是對於課程的安排上比較沒那麼嚴謹，上課時間談笑風生的時間和教學時間大概是3:2，覺得應該可以多講授更實際、更能夠提升我們做模型的技巧，或是講授更多關於都市景觀或建築的知識，不然其實老師對於規劃實務的課程實質幫助不大，不知道是不是課程安排上的問題？但無倫如何都認為老師可以減少過多的閒話時間,"Although the teacher has a humorous personality and a relaxed way of teaching, he is not so strict in the arrangement of the courses. The time for talking and laughing during the class time and the teaching time are about 3:2. I think it should be more practical to teach more and improve our modeling skills. , or to teach more about urban landscape or architecture, otherwise the teacher will not be of much help to the planning practice courses.

I feel that there is a lot of room for improvement in the details of designing courses and inviting speakers, so that students can arrange other things with peace of mind , instead of notifying the lecture information a week ago, which would cause a conflict with the original arrangement, especially considering that the attendance score of this course is quite high, and it is quite puzzling when there is a risk of infection Still insist on physical classes, and even when the whole school announces distance, it still does not provide remote options.

The teaching in class was very boring, and I felt like I hadn’t learned anything at all. I was just forced to sit there and listen to the teacher make a bunch of unpleasant remarks. They said they wanted to teach models and didn't teach much. It took three hours to teach our students what they could make in half an hour. I hope that the teaching content of the model will be canceled soon. It is just a waste of time for students to learn nothing. The teacher himself said that the industry does not need it at present. I don’t understand why we insist on doing it. What’s more, the school has changed to a comprehensive distance learning and requires all groups.

630cf1ba40e337e60fce0594,對於有基礎者能自主學習(遠距學習)來說，給予蠻大的彈性空間，無基礎者也無須擔心，自主學習時的步驟都相當清楚，老師與助教也相當和善，不太會有學習的困難。本堂課需要準備分組專案發表，只要不排斥學習程式語法，也能發現程式其實相當好用~,"For those who have basic knowledge and can learn independently (distance learning), there is a lot of flexibility. Those who do not have basic knowledge do not need to worry. The steps of self-learning are quite clear, and the teachers and teaching assistants are also very kind, so there is not much learning Difficulties.

630cf1ba40e337e60fce0515,我知道一開始憲法真的很難懂，其實到現在我都還是覺得憲法範圍跟準備方式很難全部掌握  所以當老師在臉書上推出一部部影片時，我其實是有點混亂的，有可能憲法架構本來就不像刑民法有很清晰的架構，我也建議老師可以不要把影片放在臉書上，或許可以換個平台，用更有架構的方式整理  比如放在wm5,"I know that the constitution was really difficult to understand at the beginning. In fact, I still feel that the scope and preparation methods of the constitution are difficult to grasp. So when the teacher released a video on Facebook, I was actually a little confused. Maybe The constitutional structure is not as clear as the criminal and civil law. I also suggest that the teacher should not put the video on Facebook. Maybe they can change the platform and organize it in a more structured way, such as wm5",776,124,0,2,0.0007368922233581543

630cf1ba40e337e60fce0578,老師和助教都很用心，能讓學生們去思考周圍所發生的事情進行討論我覺得很好；可是其實並不知道我們的分數到底是怎麽計算的，所以對總平均出來的時候并沒有太大的概念，上學期的期末成績也沒有公佈分數，所以在分數的計算方式會稍微有疑惑。,"The teachers and teaching assistants are very attentive, and I think it is very good to let the students think about what happened around them and discuss; but in fact, we don’t know how our scores are calculated, so we don’t have much concern about the total average. The concept of last semester's final grades did not publish scores, so there will be some doubts about the calculation method of scores.",167,121,0,1,0.0075531005859375

630cf1ba40e337e60fce04ed,希望老師可以提前告知報告的具體內容，能讓同學依據自身時間規劃，提早做準備，就不用在最後一堂課，被告知更改規則而措手不及。,"I hope that the teacher can inform the specific content of the report in advance, so that students can prepare in advance according to their own time planning, so that they don't have to be caught off guard by being told to change the rules in the last class.",823,121,0,2,0.9839739203453064

630cf1ba40e337e60fce04ef,老師的授課內容非常有趣，講授也很深入。但兩位老師共同授課部分，若能在課程大綱、報告要求上先達成更明確的共識，會讓同學預備報告上更加充分且深入。,"The content of the teacher's lectures is very interesting and the lectures are very in-depth.

630cf1ba40e337e60fce0506,老師上課給人一種親切的感覺，對學生永遠都是面帶微笑，印象中真的沒有看過老師對學生生氣，因此總是帶著一種愉悅的心情上憲法課。 我滿喜歡上憲法課，聽老師說自己求學過程的故事，更加激發我想把憲法學好的決心。,"The teacher gives people a kind feeling in class, and always smiles at the students. In my impression, I have never seen the teacher get angry with the students, so I always take a constitution class with a happy mood. I really enjoyed taking the constitutional law class. Listening to the teacher's story about my study process inspired me to learn the constitutional law well.",776,124,0,2,0.9998295307159424
630cf1ba40e337e60fce0490,平常這門課所需要做的事情就太多了，老師講課又常常偏題，讓我們時間都被壓縮到。,"Usually there are too many things to do in this class, and the teacher often deviates from the topic in the lectures, which makes our time compressed.",475,106,0,1,0.0014012455940246582
630cf1ba40e337e60fce056e,幾乎每週都會有課後小組練習，對於程式小白來說雖然要花很多時間，但對學習來說有很大的幫助，是一門很有收穫的課，雖然我還是覺得好難。,"There will be after-school group exercises almost every week.

630cf1ba40e337e60fce0512,老師上課很有趣，但影片有點多，希望老師可以先整理成一個播放清單，方便觀看，講義部分希望可以統一發佈在moodle或存放在一個雲端資料夾內，這樣下載比較方便。,"The teacher's class is very interesting, but there are a lot of videos.

630cf1ba40e337e60fce04f1,期末報告設在學期結束後一天就算了 甚至還在前一週突然多一個書面報告要我們暑假第一週交 理由是要交畢業生成績 所以不能延後  既然教授知道自己要交成績就早點公告作業啊 我們真的沒有義務要配合這些莫名其妙的東西 拜託改進 當大家都不用讀別科？,"The end-of-semester report is set one day after the end of the semester, even the week before. Suddenly there is another written report that we have to hand in in the first week of summer vacation. The reason is that we have to hand in the grades of the graduates, so we can’t postpone it. Since the professor knows that he has to hand in the grades, he should announce the homework earlier.

630cf1ba40e337e60fce04eb,課程中所採取的外出踏查、地理實察等設計使得課程豐富及有趣，但每堂課程中各組同學的報告時間稍多，但仍是有趣的課程,"The design of going out for field trips and geographical investigations in the course makes the course rich and interesting.

630cf1ba40e337e60fce0572,很喜歡上老師的課，但希望可以抓好每一篇小說討論和報告的時間，不然感覺每次都是前兩篇講比較久，後面兩篇因為時間關係就討論地比較淺，有點可惜～但還是很謝謝老師總是鼓勵我們發言，這堂課也讓我收穫很多！,"I really like the teacher's class, but I hope that I can make good use of the time to discuss and report each novel. Otherwise, I feel that the first two articles will be discussed for a long time every time, and the latter two will be discussed shallowly due to time constraints.

630cf1bb40e337e60fce05d7,上課方式很多元，老師也熱衷於教學，能學到除了課本外的東西。希望發言分數的比例可以佔少一點。,"There are many ways to teach, and the teachers are also keen on teaching, and they can learn things other than textbooks. I hope that the proportion of speech scores can be less.",9,134,0,1,0.9548461437225342

630cf1bb40e337e60fce05da,很喜歡這堂課老師要帶給我們的內容，覺得獲益良多。只是很可惜這學期上課人數太多，導致課程進度有點趕，老師的注意也會被過多的組別給分散。,"I really like the content that the teacher will bring to us in this class, and I feel that I have benefited a lot. It's just a pity that there are too many people in class this semester, which leads to a bit of rush in the course progress, and the teacher's attention will be distracted by too many groups.",9,134,0,1,0.007372081279754639
630cf1bb40e337e60fce05e2,這門課的實作多於講授，但我覺得學到很多。老師本人閱歷豐富，常常舉自己生活中的經歷來帶出管理學的相關概念；而且老師口條清晰流暢，不太會讓人想睡。再者，小組報告和管理遊戲讓我們把學理知識應用在實務上，增進我們對實務的認識和經驗。另外想感謝老師願意回答我們連番轟炸的提問；讓我們在課本知識以外，對業界和社會有更多認識。雖然以後應該沒機會再修到老師的課，但我會記得老師在課堂上講過的話，繼續努力豐富自己的人生。,"This course is more hands-on than lectured, but I feel like I learned a lot. The teacher himself has a wealth of experience, and often uses his own experience in life to bring out related concepts of management; and the teacher speaks clearly and fluently, which is not likely to make people sleepy. Furthermore, group reports and management games allow us to apply academic knowledge to practice and enhance our understanding and experience of practice. In addition, I would like to thank the teacher for being willing to answer our bombarding questions; let us learn more about the industry and society beyond textbook knowledge. Although I may not have the opportunity to take the teacher's class again in the future, I will remember what the teacher said in class and continue to work hard to enrich my life.",9,134,0,1,0.9994333386421204

630cf1ba40e337e60fce051b,老師教學認真，會很詳盡的講述內容，而且口齒非常清晰！遠距的教學影片連開兩倍速都還是能很清楚的明白老師在講什麼，老師的教學設備（PPT、教材、麥克風等）也準備的很完善！,"The teacher is serious in teaching, will explain the content in detail, and speak very clearly!

630cf1ba40e337e60fce04e5,演講安排得太緊湊且密集，相當疲勞；有些講者的民族主義心態較重，演講時能感覺到對主流社會/文化或科學的有偏見的敵意，或者談論議題時，忽視了這個議題可能是經濟結構性問題，只從族群關係的角度分析。,"Lectures are arranged too closely and densely, which is quite exhausting; some speakers have a strong nationalistic attitude, and can feel prejudiced hostility to mainstream society/culture or science when speaking, or when talking about an issue, ignoring the issue may be Economic structural issues are only analyzed from the perspective of ethnic relations.",819,121,0,3,0.0009526610374450684

630cf1ba40e337e60fce04ee,在期末報告前一週才臨時通知需要繳交書面報告，在這之前完全沒有旭明期末報告的形式、要求等，讓學生非常錯愕，在期末週實在是沒有充足的時間準備這項書面報告,"The written report was notified just one week before the final report. Before that, there was no form or requirement for Xuming's final report, which made the students very surprised. There was really not enough time to prepare the written report during the final week.",823,121,0,2,0.0019342303276062012

630cf1ba40e337e60fce049b,老師真的很棒～非常喜歡上課的氛圍，透過老師的說明讓社會學變得很親人很有趣，不會是只有枯燥的理論和文本 今年的兩位助教也都很好～沒有距離感，也給我們很多鼓勵 真的非常喜歡以琳的課(*¯︶¯*)適合想要接觸社會學卻沒有太多基礎的大家,"The teacher is really great~ I like the atmosphere of the class very much. Through the teacher's explanation, sociology becomes very close and interesting, not just boring theories and texts. The two teaching assistants this year are also very good~ There is no sense of distance, and they are also very good. Give us a lot of encouragement, I really like Yilin's class (*¯︶¯*) It is suitable for everyone who wants to get in touch with sociology but does not have much foundation",659,104,0,3,0.9987598657608032
630cf1ba40e337e60fce049c,以琳老師將社會學入門的必備知識以淺顯易懂的方式講述，考試及作業負擔不大且不死板，加上老師上課很活潑有趣，讓我對社會學這門科目有了一樣的認知，也產生了一定程度地興趣。總體而言，非常推薦想嘗試接觸社會學領域的同學修習此課！（而且老師和助教人都超好超可愛的：D,"Teacher Yilin explained the necessary knowledge of sociology in an easy-to-understand way. The exam and homework burden is not heavy and not rigid. In addition, the teacher is very lively and interesting in class, so I have the same understanding of sociology as a subject. There is also a certain degree of interest. Overall, I highly recommend students who want to try to get in touch with the field of sociology to take this course!

630cf1ba40e337e60fce04b0,Reading 太簡單了，作為大學科目和一門必修課，應有比 巷仔口社會學 更適宜和更有深度的閱讀。  老師的研究領域是家庭和教育社會學，這兩個單元的課程內容，老師都會上到眼睛發亮，可以感覺的到老師對社會學的熱情。唯一的議老師在比較不同理論時可以更有脈絡，如功能論未能提出____，而衝突會解決了這個問題，而非發散的說明，教授上會使學生更清楚不同理論之間的差異。  另也推薦老師將 Reading 多融入課堂，增加學生閱讀的意願和機率。,"Reading is too simple. As a university subject and a compulsory course, there should be more appropriate and in-depth reading than Xiangzaikou Sociology. The teacher's research field is family and educational sociology. The course content of these two units, the teacher's eyes are bright, and the teacher's enthusiasm for sociology can be felt. The only argument teacher can be more contextual when comparing different theories. For example, functional theory fails to propose ____, and the conflict will solve this problem instead of divergent explanations. The professor will make students more aware of the differences between different theories . It is also recommended that teachers integrate Reading more into the classroom to increase students' willingness and probability of reading.",659,104,0,3,0.7580254077911377
630cf1ba40e337e60fce04ae,老師上課講解很清楚，且助教課的內容更能深入了解每周所講解的議題，讓我對社會學有進一步的認識!,"The teacher explained clearly in class, and the content of the teaching assistant class gave me a better understanding of the topics explained every week, which gave me a better understanding of sociology!",659,104,0,3,0.42419421672821045

630cf1ba40e337e60fce04cf,宋頭目上課非常有趣！意外喜歡的課，雖然修這堂課的都是大一弟妹，但推薦給雙轉有想修完系上的人修，學得到東西又不會感覺太負擔，期中一個禮拜內一定能讀好（上課要認真）,"Boss Song's class is very interesting! I unexpectedly like the class.

630cf1bb40e337e60fce05c7,我覺得課程分佈有點不太平均，套路的操作佔比有些少，會有點學不太起來，也希望老師能夠補齊每一個動作分解的動作（不是連續的那種），這個真的很有幫助。不過也很感謝老師這學期的教導，學到很多動作的細部和相關的課外知識,"I think the distribution of the courses is a bit uneven, and the proportion of routine operations is a little small, so I can't learn it well. I also hope that the teacher can complete the movements of each movement (not the continuous one). This is really helpful. .

Talking about other topics in class until the end, rushing to class or delaying the end of class is annoying. 2. Too many reports and the calculation method is not transparent.

630cf1bb40e337e60fce05e1,老師請好好上課好嗎，上點有用的內容，不要一直講重複的東西,"Teacher, please take a good class, please provide some useful content, don't keep talking about repetitive things",9,134,0,1,0.9982615113258362
630cf1bb40e337e60fce05db,希望老師可以更講清楚對於作業和報告的要求，常常會令人感覺摸不著頭緒。如果發言算期末總成績很大一部份的話，那是不是可以平均分配讓每個人發言的次數呢？（或許可以以小組為單位平均分配），因為感覺都是同一群人在發言，其他或許還在思考怎麼發言的同學就這樣失去發言機會了（可以瞭解因為上課人數很多人造成有些肉弱強食，但生性比較害羞的人其實也是想把握發言機會的！）。也可能因為班上人數太多的關係，在小組報告和帶活動的時候也常常覺得滿混亂的，有點可惜。,"I hope the teacher can clarify the requirements for homework and reports, which often makes people feel confused. If speech counts as a large part of the total final grade, is it possible to evenly distribute the number of times for each person to speak? (Maybe it can be evenly distributed in groups), because it feels like the same group of people are speaking, and other students who may still be thinking about how to speak will lose the opportunity to speak in this way. , but people who are shy by nature actually want to seize the opportunity to speak!). It may also be because of the large number of people in the class, it is a pity that I often feel chaotic during group reports and activities.",9,134,0,1,0.0005075931549072266
630cf1ba40e337e60fce04f0,建議老師可以提早說明期中報告的要求，讓同學有充分的時間準備，期中週還有其他的科目要讀，卻要趕在一週內產出期中報告。 除外，若有需要實地踏查的作業也希望老師可以提前二至三週說明，並不是每個同學假日都有閒置的時間可以隨時運用。,"It is suggested that the teacher can explain the requirements of the mid-term report in advance, so that students have enough time to prepare. There are other subjects to study in the mid-term week, but they have to produce the mid-term report within a week. In addition, if there is an assignment that requires on-the-spot investigation, I hope the teacher can explain it two to three weeks in advance. Not every student has free time during the holidays that can be used at any time.",823,121,0,2,0.0041599273681640625
630cf1ba40e337e60fce04cc,這堂課真的很棒，非常喜歡老師的上課內容。如果遠距的影片可以留比較久讓同學複習的話會更好！,"This class is really good, I really like the content of the teacher's class. It would be even better if the remote videos can be kept for a longer period of time for students to review!",828,116,0,2,0.9996439218521118

630cf1ba40e337e60fce04a9,本學期我修習的所有課程當中最喜歡的就是以琳老師的社會學。上老師的課能夠學到很多，但卻不會感到負擔太重。雖然課程內容本身有比較枯燥乏味的部分，但是老師總是能夠用有趣的方式去講述課程。另外，從老師選擇的延伸讀物和助教課的課程安排都能感受到老師對課程的用心。,"Among all the courses I have taken this semester, my favorite is Sociology taught by Teacher Yilin. You can learn a lot from the teacher's class, but you don't feel too burdened. Although the course content itself has some boring parts, the teacher can always tell the course in an interesting way. In addition, from the extended reading materials selected by the teacher and the curriculum arrangement of the teaching assistant class, we can feel the teacher's dedication to the course.",659,104,0,3,0.9984716773033142

630cf1ba40e337e60fce04a8,我覺得老師考試內容可以多一些申論題。 遠距的影片不太清楚為什麼要下架，如果不下架讓我們自由調配上課時間更彈性。,"I think the content of the teacher's exam can have more application questions. It is not clear why the long-distance videos were taken off the shelves.

630cf1ba40e337e60fce0579,請老師調整考試方式：老師和助教將期末筆試申論改成口試申論，每一題僅讓學生發表3分鐘的內容，我認為時間不夠故不合理。另外，助教轉達老師說，期末口試申論的題目可能會視情況改變，是否表示每個同學的考題可能相異？我認為這是些許不公平的。  另外，我希望老師可以給予我們上學期期末考的成績，我認為已經過了一個學期應該可以讓我們了解哪些部分需要改進與訂正了。  但是老師確實很用心讓學生討論。,"Teachers are requested to adjust the examination method: the teacher and teaching assistants changed the final written examination application to oral examination application, and students are only allowed to express their content for 3 minutes for each question. I think the time is not enough and it is unreasonable. In addition, the teaching assistant conveyed to the teacher that the topic of the final oral examination may change depending on the situation. Does it mean that each student's examination questions may be different? I think that's a little bit unfair. In addition, I hope that the teacher can give us the results of the final exam of the last semester. I think that after a semester, we should be able to understand which parts need to be improved and corrected. But the teacher is really very attentive to let the students discuss.",167,121,0,1,0.3451133370399475
630cf1ba40e337e60fce0567,這堂課可以學到非常多R語言的知識，教授從零開始教的。但程上起來的負擔也滿重的，做作業時需要花很多時間自行學習更多的知識，但整體來說這是一堂可以扎時學習將R語言應用在經濟研究的課程。,"You can learn a lot of R language knowledge in this class, and the professor taught it from scratch.

I have learned a lot, but I have to hand in seven videos after a long distance. The burden is a bit heavy. I hope the teacher can adjust it later. Thank you.",185,135,0,1,0.02701246738433838
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0673,這門課真的很棒，可惜之後遠距，不然好想去走路啊,"This class is really great, but it's a pity that it will be far away later, otherwise I really want to walk",193,135,0,1,0.037469327449798584
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06a8,希望老師上課可以有更多補充資料給學生看，或是有完整一點的講義，不然有時候無法充分理解老師所說的內容，但老師還是相當用心~~,"I hope the teacher can have more supplementary materials for students to read in class, or have a little more complete handouts, otherwise sometimes I can’t fully understand what the teacher said, but the teacher is still very attentive~~",776,144,0,2,0.9959592223167419

630cf1bb40e337e60fce06fa,老師採用中文課本授課幫我們減輕很多負擔，和老師約討論對我們問卷設計超有幫助，好感謝！助教課對於之後spss作業很有幫助，但希望助教能解決其他組沒上助教課，拿不到講義的問題，否則會一直被其他組別騷擾，讓我們很困擾。,"The teacher uses Chinese textbooks to help us reduce a lot of burdens, and discussing with the teacher is very helpful for our questionnaire design, thank you very much! The teaching assistant class is very helpful for the spss homework in the future, but I hope that the teaching assistant can solve the problem that other groups have not attended the teaching assistant class and cannot get the handouts, otherwise they will always be harassed by other groups, which makes us very troubled.",12,690,0,3,0.985626757144928
630cf1bc40e337e60fce072b,雖然因為遠距只有上過一次張老師的課，但是老師線上的教學影片品質也很好！都能聽懂,"Although I only attended Teacher Zhang's class once because of the distance, the quality of the teacher's online teaching videos is also very good! can understand",2,158,3,1,0.999841570854187
630cf1bc40e337e60fce07ae,雖然知道老師是為了公平考量才對線上考試那麼嚴格，但也希望能夠有彈性空間，否則稍出差錯就直接0真的會讓人很害怕，擔心自己就因為操作不當被當。導致最後考試前都只是在操作設備而不是讀書。,"Although I know that the teacher is so strict with the online exam for the sake of fairness, but I also hope that there is room for flexibility, otherwise it will be really scary to directly 0 if there is a slight mistake, and I worry that I will be judged because of improper operation. As a result, before the final exam, I was just operating the equipment instead of reading.",99,166,0,1,0.0003685951232910156
630cf1bb40e337e60fce070e,Benny老師給予大家的思考及討論空間非常大！很鼓勵我們提出自己的想法 謝謝這學期的教導～,Teacher Benny gives you a lot of room for thinking and discussion! We are very encouraged to put forward our own ideas. Thank you for teaching this semester~,9,147,0,1,0.9991944432258606
630cf1bb40e337e60fce05f3,老師很用心準備上課教材，學生報告時也很用心聆聽並提供很好的意見,"The teacher is very attentive in preparing the teaching materials for the class, and listens carefully to the students' reports and provides good opinions",720,689,0,3,0.9996408224105835
630cf1bb40e337e60fce062b,老師超棒！教學很認真，動作指導跟講解都很詳細，也會一步一步帶著我們做分解動作，課堂上實施了很多練習讓我們熟悉基本的技術運用；對待學生也很有耐心，會針對個人的動作做細部的調整跟說明，學生沒到課也會關心狀況，而且很尊重學生，拿學生的球來示範還會說抱歉讓你去撿球了🥺 這堂課讓我對匹克球提起很大的興趣，雖然有點可惜學期最後遠距的操作方式比較麻煩但理解老師是想讓我們有更多的操作機會，很慶幸選到老師的課！,"The teacher is great! The teaching is very serious, the action guidance and explanation are very detailed, and he will also guide us to break down the action step by step. A lot of exercises have been implemented in the class to make us familiar with the basic technique application; he is also very patient with the students, and will do according to individual actions. With detailed adjustments and explanations, students will care about the situation when they are not in class, and they respect students very much. They will use the students' balls to demonstrate and say sorry for asking you to pick up the ball. This class made me very interested in pickleball , although it is a pity that the remote operation method at the end of the semester is more troublesome, but I understand that the teacher wants us to have more operation opportunities, and I am very glad to have chosen the teacher's class!",185,135,0,1,0.998275876045227
630cf1bc40e337e60fce07a7,老師上課很認真，但可能因為經濟學內容很多所以需要一直趕進度，因此可能課程節奏會太快，實體上課的時候三小時如果分心一下可能就落後很多，所以希望老師可以再放慢一點或是刪去一些較不重要的章節(比較偏向其他系的做法)，讓整個課程步調慢一點。以及教到後面經濟學符號實在太多，會一直搞混、有時候又有老師自創的縮寫，所以可能會比較難懂一些。但老師的教學內容是真的很充實。,"The teacher is very serious in class, but because of the large amount of economics content, he needs to keep up with the progress, so the pace of the course may be too fast. If you are distracted for three hours during the physical class, you may fall behind a lot, so I hope the teacher can slow down or It is to delete some less important chapters (more biased towards the practice of other departments) and make the pace of the whole course slower. And there are too many symbols in economics after teaching, and they will always be confused. Sometimes there are abbreviations created by the teacher, so it may be more difficult to understand. But the teacher's teaching content is really substantial.",99,166,0,1,0.9919294118881226
630cf1bb40e337e60fce070c,老師人很好，有什麼問題也都樂於解答。上這堂課還可以刺激自己的思考,The teacher is very nice and willing to answer any questions. Taking this class can also stimulate your own thinking,9,147,0,1,0.999817430973053
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0623,遠距之後的錄影要求生出匹克球拍跟匹克球很不合理，因為疫情請假但補課卻只能補一次也不合理,"It is unreasonable to ask for pickleball rackets and pickle balls after long-distance video recording, and it is unreasonable to ask for leave because of the epidemic but only make up one time of make-up class",185,135,0,1,0.0020551085472106934
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0626,老師辛苦了！雖然考試還是有人沒辦法一次過，例如我，但老師真的教的很好,"The teacher has worked hard! Although there are still some people who can't pass the exam once, such as me, the teacher is really good at teaching",185,135,0,1,0.9997901320457458
630cf1bc40e337e60fce072c,謝謝兩位老師的認真教學，這門課程雖然偶爾會覺得有點難，但整體而言讓我獲益良多，謝謝老師。,"Thanks to the two teachers for their serious teaching. Although this course is a bit difficult occasionally, it has benefited me a lot overall. Thank you teachers.",2,158,3,1,0.9998606443405151
630cf1bb40e337e60fce070f,老師會邀請講者，收穫良多。只要跟老師說明自己的需求，老師都會盡全力達成，很盡責。,"The teacher will invite the speakers and gain a lot. As long as you explain your needs to the teacher, the teacher will do his best to achieve it and is very responsible.",9,147,0,1,0.9997493624687195
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0636,板書可以再大一點 教室後排或遠距易看不清楚,"The writing on the blackboard can be bigger, it is easy to read in the back row of the classroom or from a distance",99,131,0,1,0.015548944473266602
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0638,老師講解得非常詳細，我覺得可以改善的地方是板書可以再寫大一點。,The teacher explained it in great detail. I think what can be improved is that the writing on the blackboard can be bigger.,99,131,0,1,0.9726585149765015
630cf1bc40e337e60fce07a9,老師上課非常充實，除了課本內容，不時也會補充相關知識，私下問老師問題，也會詳細解答。老師有時也很幽默，不會覺得上起課來很死板無趣，是一堂很棒的課!謝謝老師這一年的教導!,"The teacher's class is very fulfilling. In addition to the content of the textbook, he will also supplement relevant knowledge from time to time, ask the teacher questions in private, and answer them in detail.

630cf1bb40e337e60fce0708,分組報告能學到的東西很多，但更希望能夠有架構的學習管理學知識，邀請的講師也很好，但希望能減少一兩位，多一點時間在課堂管理學上。很謝謝老師用心良苦為我們邀請優秀的講師，也從他們身上學到很多！,"There are many things to learn from the group report, but I hope to have a structured learning management knowledge. The invited lecturers are also very good, but I hope to reduce one or two and spend more time on classroom management. I am very grateful to the teacher for inviting excellent lecturers for us with good intentions, and I have learned a lot from them!",9,147,0,1,0.9995182752609253

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0775,老師教導了博物館相關的內容，讓我們有策展的機會，雖然很累，但收獲滿滿，策展完成感覺很有成就感。,"The teacher taught museum-related content and gave us the opportunity to curate. Although it was tiring, it was full of rewards and I felt a sense of accomplishment after completing the curation.",830,162,0,3,0.9997435212135315
630cf1bc40e337e60fce07a2,老師上課講解得很清楚，但有時會覺得有一點太快。另外，開始遠距以後，實習課講義上的題目都有附詳解，我認為有詳解更能幫助我們學習。,"The teacher explained clearly in class, but sometimes felt a little too fast. In addition, after starting to distance, the topics in the practical lectures have detailed explanations. I think detailed explanations can help us learn more.",99,166,0,1,0.026346981525421143
630cf1bb40e337e60fce05f2,老師人很好，也很樂於解決同學問題！謝謝老師和助教～,The teachers are very nice and willing to solve students' problems! Thank you teacher and teaching assistant~,720,689,0,3,0.9998490810394287
630cf1bb40e337e60fce05f4,老師人很好，課程也會提點重點，但希望交易報告的部分可以講解詳細一點！,"The teacher is very good, and the course will also mention some key points, but I hope that the part of the transaction report can be explained in more detail!",720,689,0,3,0.9993962049484253
630cf1bc40e337e60fce07a8,我認為非同步遠距比較好，內容豐富，但實體上課有時候還在理解上一part老師就已經講到很後面了，希望師講代號的時候可以多重複幾次代號的意思，老師常常只提了一次代號的意思就開始都用代號,"I think asynchronous distance is better, and the content is rich, but sometimes I still understand that the teacher has already talked about the end of the last part in the physical class. I hope that the teacher can repeat the meaning of the code several times when explaining the code.

630cf1bb40e337e60fce064b,謝謝老師在這門初級課程真的教得很初級，把每個動作都一步一步慢慢帶。,"Thank you teacher for teaching this elementary course very elementary, taking each movement step by step slowly.",185,135,0,1,0.9993911981582642
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06e8,希望老師往後的課程都會錄影，演算法蠻有難度的，需要課後複習,I hope that the teacher will record the lessons in the future. The algorithm is quite difficult and needs to be reviewed after class.,831,149,0,3,0.0005058050155639648

630cf1bc40e337e60fce07af,老師對學生的學習很關心，但社課時很多內容都很快就帶過，我在解釋過一次其定義後就職借用英文簡稱說明概念，讓我也時候難跟上上課的節奏跟步調，加上老師常認為有些內容很簡單或以講過類似概念就不再多做解釋，板書字跡又小又淡，坐在中間以後都看不清楚黑板的字。希望老師可以放慢教學速度，然後在重要概念時將概念解釋清楚，不要課文念過就過去了><不過遠距錄影片上課效果很棒，因為可以一直倒帶重聽比較難理解的概念!總之很感謝老師的用心教學，但能改善上述問題就更棒了!,"The teacher is very concerned about the students' learning, but a lot of content is quickly covered in the social class. After explaining its definition, I borrow the English abbreviation to explain the concept, which makes it difficult for me to keep up with the rhythm and pace of the class. Teachers often think that some content is very simple or they don’t need to explain more after talking about similar concepts. I hope that the teacher can slow down the teaching speed, and then explain the concepts clearly when important concepts are encountered, so as not to pass the text after reading the text><However, the remote video class is very effective, because you can always rewind and listen to more difficult concepts! In short, I am very grateful to the teacher for his hard teaching, but it will be even better if the above problems can be improved!",99,166,0,1,0.9735875129699707
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0705,老師非常之優秀 上課不會有過重的負擔卻能使學生收益良多 是個非常棒的一堂課,"The teacher is very good. The class will not be too heavy, but it can benefit the students a lot. It is a very good class",9,147,0,1,0.9998784065246582

630cf1bb40e337e60fce064f,希望老師在遠距課程不要強人所難要求學生要拍攝練習影片，如果已返家的同學根本借不到器材拍攝，要為了這堂課程特地返回學校或是到體育館群聚，不就有失遠距課程的初衷嗎？,"I hope that teachers will not force students to take practice videos during distance courses. If students who have returned home cannot borrow equipment to shoot, they have to return to school or go to the gymnasium to gather together for this course, and they will lose distance courses. original intention?",185,135,0,1,0.0003167390823364258
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0629,理解老師對於教學的熱誠，但是遠距以後的作業真的很麻煩，做的很崩潰,"I understand the teacher's enthusiasm for teaching, but the homework after a long distance is really troublesome, and the work is very broken",185,135,0,1,0.0002753138542175293

630cf1bb40e337e60fce06c4,老師上課非常認真，並且樂於解決學生問題，也鼓勵學生發問。而且也會補充一些課本簡單帶過的部分，讓我們能更了解課程內容。,"The teacher is very serious in class, and is willing to solve students' problems, and encourages students to ask questions. And it will also add some parts that are simply mentioned in the textbook, so that we can better understand the content of the course.",96,142,0,1,0.9981229901313782
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0627,並非每位同學都有匹克球拍與球，因疫情而返家的同學（我）可能會因此無法完成作業而感到困擾。,"Not every student has a pickleball racket and ball, and a classmate (me) who returned home due to the epidemic may be troubled by not being able to complete homework.",185,135,0,1,0.0005859136581420898

630cf1bb40e337e60fce06cd,老師教學認真，且喜歡鼓勵同學發言討論，上課不容易枯燥,"The teacher is serious in teaching and likes to encourage students to speak and discuss, so the class is not easy to be boring",96,142,0,1,0.9979987740516663
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06d3,課本選得蠻好的，內容不會太難，老師給分很佛，但是上課完全照著課本上，希望可以多一點老師的整理或補充題目會更好,"The textbook selection is quite good, the content is not too difficult, the teacher gave a good score, but the class is completely according to the textbook, I hope it will be better if there are more teachers to sort out or supplement the questions",96,142,0,1,0.9904528856277466
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0604,老詩人很好! 會個別查看大家的動作 雖然網球對於初學者不容易，但是整體覺得很有趣好玩，老師也會一直鼓勵我們~,"The old poet is very good! I will check everyone's movements individually. Although tennis is not easy for beginners, I think it is very interesting and fun on the whole. The teacher will always encourage us~",188,135,0,1,0.9998846054077148

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0776,這學期收穫滿滿，不愧是系上人氣最高的一堂課~每次看他組開展，大家交流意見的同時，也不斷反思自己怎麼做會更好。雖然很可惜這次沒有辦法實體策展，但線上策展也獲益良多，希望在畢業前有實體策展的機會。,"This semester has been full of rewards, and it is indeed the most popular class in the department~ Every time I watch the development of other groups, everyone exchanges opinions and constantly reflects on how they can do better. Although it is a pity that there is no way to curate in person this time, online curation has also benefited a lot, and I hope to have the opportunity to curate in person before graduation.",830,162,0,3,0.9994480013847351
630cf1bb40e337e60fce065d,遠距之後的拍片對不太會控球的人真的是大災難 但老師真的讚,"The filming after a long distance is really a disaster for people who are not good at handling the ball, but the teacher really appreciates it",188,135,0,1,0.9968284964561462

630cf1bb40e337e60fce062a,老師授課非常認真，而且很有耐心，很喜歡老師的教學方式～只是這堂課的考試真的太難，期末要交的影片也很多，有點難以負荷。,"The teacher is very serious and patient in teaching, and I really like the teacher's teaching method~ It's just that the exam in this class is really too difficult, and there are a lot of videos to be handed in at the end of the semester, which is a bit overwhelming.",185,135,0,1,0.02033168077468872

630cf1bb40e337e60fce0635,廖老師上課態度十分認真、用心，教學內容充實，授課講解時詳盡完善，基本上每周都有作業，可以即時驗收學習效果，是堂很充實的經濟學課! 老師也很樂意解決學生課堂上的問題~ 唯期中期末考試題目偏難，準備上頗花心力><,"Teacher Liao is very serious and attentive in class, the teaching content is substantial, and the lectures are detailed and perfect. Basically, there are homework every week, and the learning effect can be checked immediately. It is a very fulfilling economics class! The teacher is also happy to solve the problems in the class.

630cf1bb40e337e60fce063c,老師很認真，講解也很詳細，但希望寫在白板、黑板的字可以再大一些。,"The teacher is very serious and the explanations are very detailed, but I hope that the words written on the whiteboard and blackboard can be bigger.",99,131,0,1,0.959047257900238
630cf1bb40e337e60fce064c,老師對動作的講解很詳細，我覺得就算平常沒在運動的學生也能經由老師的講解漸入佳境,The teacher's explanation of the movements is very detailed. I think even students who don't usually exercise can get better through the teacher's explanation.,185,135,0,1,0.9868981838226318

630cf1bb40e337e60fce063e,希望老師上課時候字可以寫大一點，在錄影時可以離黑板近一點聲音才比較清楚 此外，希望老師可以考慮降低期末考比重，提高作業的比重,"I hope that the teacher can write larger words in class, and the sound can be clearer when he is closer to the blackboard when recording. In addition, I hope the teacher can consider reducing the proportion of final exams and increasing the proportion of homework",99,131,0,1,0.010764539241790771

630cf1bb40e337e60fce06c5,對於商學院的學生來說，我認為這堂課的課程內容不算太難，老師上課也很認真，但是考試的深度有些超出預期，希望考試能稍微再簡單一些,"For business school students, I think the course content of this class is not too difficult, and the teacher is very serious in class, but the depth of the exam is a bit beyond expectations. I hope the exam can be a little easier",96,142,0,1,0.9919398427009583
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06d0,老師很用心 但期末考範圍稍多,"The teacher is very attentive, but the scope of the final exam is slightly larger",96,142,0,1,0.9696976542472839
630cf1bc40e337e60fce078c,期末考有點複雜，希望可以簡化制度,"The final exam is a bit complicated, I hope the system can be simplified",792,154,3,1,0.00116044282913208
630cf1bb40e337e60fce063d,老師寫的筆記有點小，經常看不清楚,"The notes written by the teacher are a bit small, and they are often not clear",99,131,0,1,0.00022393465042114258
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0605,期末分析作業改成遠距後實行稍微困難 以及要找已經見不到面的組員互評真的好難...... 我做完分析作業了但找不到相同進度的組員,"It is a little difficult to implement the end-of-term analysis assignment after changing it to a remote location, and it is really difficult to find team members who have not seen each other to evaluate each other... I have finished the analysis assignment but cannot find a team member who has made the same progress",188,135,0,1,0.00040656328201293945
630cf1bb40e337e60fce065f,老師的田野經驗非常豐富，授課內容也非常扎實！但希望之後可以在學期初就先安排好每週的作業並予以說明，方能讓學生有更多時間好好準備與吸收～～,"The teacher's field experience is very rich, and the teaching content is also very solid! But I hope that in the future, the weekly homework can be arranged and explained at the beginning of the semester, so that students can have more time to prepare and absorb~~",833,132,0,3,0.9996925592422485

630cf1bb40e337e60fce0701,選課比較多的狀況下每個禮拜的文本份量其實蠻重的，而且有幾份的英文又特別難讀，讀起來有點吃力。會希望老師未來的課程有機會先帶大家做隔週文本簡單導讀～～ 還有針對老師不提供電子檔給學生的理由，之前聽老師意思應該是怕傳承給下一屆等等，不過其實如果每一屆都有提供電子檔的話我不認為會產生相關問題（大家其實不會刻意跟前一屆資料比較說，前一屆的少了兩頁那我只要讀前一屆的不讀現在的）。提出這個點一部分是因為環保、另一部分是因為便利（不論是用平板或電腦），在查詢資料也較便利。希望給老師參考。,"In the case of a large number of courses, the weight of each week's text is actually quite heavy, and some of the English are particularly difficult to read, making it a bit difficult to read. I hope that the teacher will have the opportunity to take everyone to do a brief introduction to the text every other week in the future courses~~ There is also a reason for the teacher not to provide electronic files to the students. I heard the teacher said that he is afraid of passing it on to the next class, etc., but in fact, if every I don’t think there will be any problems if electronic files are provided in the previous session (in fact, people will not deliberately compare with the previous session’s materials, if the previous session’s materials are two pages short, then I only need to read the previous session’s materials instead of the current one). This point is raised partly because of environmental protection, and partly because of convenience (whether using a tablet or a computer), and it is also more convenient to query information. I hope it will be a reference for the teacher.",829,141,0,2,0.0055335164070129395
630cf1bc40e337e60fce079a,老師教得很好,the teacher taught well,212,155,0,3,0.999711811542511
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06e9,建議老師完整說明程式裡面的每個參數與變數的意涵，這樣比較好懂，因為老師的命名方式跟我們命名的方式不一定相同，比較難去猜測老師的想法。,"It is recommended that the teacher fully explain the meaning of each parameter and variable in the program, which is easier to understand, because the teacher's naming method is not necessarily the same as our naming method, and it is difficult to guess the teacher's thinking.",831,149,0,3,0.8288854360580444
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0658,新增運動分析作業與遠距影片，對學生而言份量有點過重。此外，遠距課程以後所以執行面的相關問題，老師與學生幾乎可以說是斷了聯繫，雖然教學大綱上寫明可以用郵件與老師聯繫，但現實上老師似乎不太看郵件或回覆郵件，因此往往難有下文，我認為本課程也可以參考其他體育老師以Line群組作為師生間較無聯繫成本之溝通橋梁。,"The addition of motion analysis assignments and remote videos is a bit too heavy for students. In addition, after distance courses, teachers and students have almost lost contact with regard to implementation-related issues. Although the syllabus states that teachers can be contacted by email, in reality teachers don’t seem to read emails or reply to emails. Therefore, it is often difficult to follow. I think this course can also refer to other physical education teachers who use the Line group as a communication bridge between teachers and students with less contact cost.",188,135,0,1,0.00047779083251953125
630cf1bb40e337e60fce070d,很認真的教授的我，記得我們這組搞砸了第一次的報告，教授很耐心地聆聽我們遇到的狀況及解決辦法，在看待事情的方面也很有自己獨到的見解，是一堂獲益良多的課程。,I am a very serious professor. I remember that our group messed up the first report. The professor patiently listened to the situation we encountered and the solution. He also had his own unique views on things. A lot of courses.,9,147,0,1,0.9991222023963928
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06c9,老師人很好而且聲音很好聽～但覺得老師上得有點太快了，導致每周要花很多時間複習，最後怕期末前來不及整個複習完，希望能再放慢速度並考試能夠再簡單一點體諒數學不好的人><！,"The teacher is very nice and the voice is nice~ But I feel that the teacher is a little too fast, which leads to spending a lot of time reviewing every week. In the end, I am afraid that I will not be able to finish the review before the end of the semester. I hope that I can slow down and make the exam easier.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0787,我覺得很好，不過期末規則冗長，考2周~~,"I think it's very good, but the end-of-term rules are lengthy, and the exam takes 2 weeks~~",792,154,3,1,0.00427699089050293
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0637,老師超棒😍😍😍，如果想學好經濟學可以選這門課，如果只想拿超高分就不建議選,"The teacher is great 😍😍😍, if you want to learn economics well, you can take this course, if you just want to get super high scores, it is not recommended to take this course",99,131,0,1,0.6491892337799072

630cf1bb40e337e60fce064d,老師一開學說會定期叫我們在上課時把自己的動作錄下來，並說會開啟moodle作業繳交區請我們上傳。但老師上課時都沒說哪天以前/什麼時候有開上傳區，每次都是同學問說為什麼突然發現之前有期限已截止的上傳區後老師才說之後會重新開。但問題是moodle有新上傳區不會自動通知，老師也沒寄信或在課堂上告訴我們，我們根本不會隨時打開moodle中的這堂課去檢查有沒有新增上傳區，變成目前沒有成功上傳過。老師每次的說詞都是不要擔心之後都有機會讓同學上傳，但老師也沒宣布過確切評分方式，很無所適從。,"When the teacher started teaching, he would regularly ask us to record our actions during class, and said that he would open the moodle homework submission area for us to upload. But the teacher didn’t say when/when the uploading area was opened in class. Every time, the students asked why they suddenly discovered that there was an uploading area that had expired before, and the teacher said that it would be reopened later. But the problem is that moodle will not automatically notify when there is a new upload area, and the teacher did not send a letter or tell us in class, we will never open this class in moodle to check whether there is a new upload area, and it has not been successful so far. uploaded. Every time the teacher said, don’t worry, you will have the opportunity to let the students upload it later, but the teacher has not announced the exact scoring method, so I am at a loss.",185,135,0,1,0.0004774332046508789
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06a5,不確定是否因為本學期選課人數過少而沒有助教，是由老師擔任助教。 希望之後能像其他班有固定的助教課。,"It is not sure whether there are no teaching assistants because the number of students enrolled in this semester is too small, and the teachers are acting as teaching assistants. I hope that in the future, there will be regular teaching assistants like other classes.",776,144,0,2,0.0014113783836364746
630cf1bc40e337e60fce072d,老師上課很認真，平常也會有一些題目給我們練習，讓我們能夠更加了解課程內容！,"The teacher is very serious in class, and usually there will be some questions for us to practice, so that we can better understand the content of the course!",2,158,3,1,0.9971729516983032
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06c7,希望老師可以期末考考簡單一些，或在期末進行調分，我每堂都很認真聽課，但考試時容易混淆，往往在考場失利，希望老師可以放水,"I hope the teacher can make the final exam easier, or adjust the grades at the end of the semester. I listen to the lectures carefully in every class, but it is easy to be confused during the exam, and I often fail in the exam room. I hope the teacher can release the water.",96,142,0,1,0.004494190216064453
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0607,因為遠距的關係，上課改成每週上傳多部練習指定動作的影片，很謝謝老師這麼用心且注重教學品質，但可能沒考慮到找場地找器材，以及練習、拍攝等種種時間成本，對於面對疫情與期末的學生而言實在太過負擔，加起來遠超過原先上課時數，希望之後若有遠距教學時老師可以酌量減輕份量。不過除此之外，實體課程時學得很開心！老師幽默風趣又很關心學生，可以學到很多網球知識的應用！,"Because of the long-distance relationship, the class was changed to upload multiple videos of practicing the specified movements every week. I am very grateful to the teacher for being so attentive and paying attention to the quality of teaching, but I may not have considered the various time costs such as finding a venue and equipment, as well as practicing and shooting. Facing the epidemic and the end-of-semester students, it is too burdensome, and the sum far exceeds the original class hours. I hope that if there is distance teaching in the future, the teacher can reduce the weight as appropriate. But other than that, it was a lot of fun learning during the physical class! The teacher is humorous and caring about the students, and he can learn a lot about the application of tennis knowledge!",188,135,0,1,0.02668476104736328
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06fe,我覺得文本量真的太多了，而且都是英文真的滿困難的，當然可以理解老師覺得這些文本很重要大家都要讀，但是真的是給越多東西就越能夠幫助同學吸收嗎？我覺得還不如給出適當的內容量，還可以提升學生的學習動機，如此反而可以更能夠提升教學的成效。不然大家儘管懷著想要學習的心，但也很容易會被成堆的原文文本擊垮。然後真的希望老師上課講話可以再清楚一點，有時候會太含糊。,"I think there are too many texts, and it is really difficult to write them all in English. Of course, it is understandable that the teacher thinks these texts are important for everyone to read, but is it true that the more things you give, the more you can help students absorb them? I think it is better to give an appropriate amount of content, which can also improve students' learning motivation, so that it can improve the effectiveness of teaching. Otherwise, although everyone has the heart to learn, it is easy to be overwhelmed by piles of original texts. Then I really hope that the teacher can speak more clearly in class, sometimes it is too vague.",829,141,0,2,0.015456616878509521
630cf1bb40e337e60fce070a,多一點像賽局這種遊戲真的會很棒，然後希望講者講的內容能更貼近我們現在的身分，不然講得太深會聽不太懂或不能理解,"It would be really great to have more games like Game Bureau, and I hope that the content of the speaker can be closer to our current identity, otherwise if the speech is too deep, it will not be understood or understood",9,147,0,1,0.002726733684539795
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0657,老師真的非常認真，也感受出很用心在教導學生，真的推推推!!但這邊也想建議，期末分析作業希望避免只能用ios系統操作的這個限制，尤其後來開始全面遠距，其實真的不太容易可以借到手機，也有點不好意思麻煩朋友。,"The teacher is really serious, and I feel that he is teaching the students very hard, really pushing and pushing!! But here I also want to suggest that the final analysis assignment hopes to avoid the limitation of only using the ios system, especially when I start to fully remote , In fact, it is really not easy to borrow a mobile phone, and I am a little embarrassed to bother my friends.",188,135,0,1,0.00991278886795044
630cf1bb40e337e60fce065c,後半學期改為遠距課程，所以老師調整成拍攝影片的形式進行評分，但有的同學返鄉後可能會面臨沒有設備、場地等問題，在影片拍攝執行上容易遇到困難。,"In the second half of the semester, it was changed to a distance course, so the teacher adjusted to the form of filming for grading. However, some students may face problems such as lack of equipment and venues after returning to their hometowns, and they are prone to encounter difficulties in filming and execution.",188,135,0,1,0.0006317496299743652

630cf1bb40e337e60fce0624,遠距之後居然還要求買一個超冷門的球拍，而且分數真的超不甜，現在體育課有學分了，真的要斟酌,"After a long distance, I actually asked to buy a super unpopular racket, and the score is really not sweet. Now that I have credits for physical education, I really have to think about it",185,135,0,1,0.02251499891281128
630cf1bb40e337e60fce070b,老師上課很有趣，期中期末各有一次小組報告，是可負擔的程度，最後的期末考可以改成繳交心得，老師人很nice,"The teacher's class is very interesting.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce07ab,用moodle系統+安全瀏覽器操作，真的是第一次，希望老師可以稍微寬容一些 多給出模擬試題或練習機會，除此之外我覺得老師課程內容都很好。,"It is really the first time to use the moodle system + safe browser to operate.

As a teacher, Huizhen often stays to chat with her I feel very warm and warm for the care of the students and teachers, thank you Teacher Huizhen! by a heavenly soldier who misremembered the time of the midterm exam",832,157,0,2,0.9997054934501648
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0788,老師很用心準備課程、講解，推推。,"The teacher is very attentive in preparing lessons, explaining, and pushing.",792,154,3,1,0.9985328912734985
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06ce,可以多準備一點非課本內的題目來上學下來的效果可能會好一點，因為有時候課本看了還是不知道怎麼用,"If you can prepare more topics that are not in the textbook, the effect may be better after school, because sometimes you still don’t know how to use it after reading the textbook",96,142,0,1,0.0016031861305236816
630cf1bb40e337e60fce066b,老師教學認真，健走課可以認識校園，也可以認識新朋友,"The teacher is serious in teaching, walking class can get to know the campus, and you can also meet new friends",193,135,0,1,0.9995092153549194
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0786,謝謝老師的教導!老師真很用心,Thank you teacher for teaching! The teacher is really hardworking,792,154,3,1,0.9991692304611206
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0671,原本很期待後面的課程結果遠距真的好可惜⋯⋯,It was a pity that I was looking forward to the results of the following courses.,193,135,0,1,0.020563185214996338
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06cf,用的教材錯誤有點多，覺得對於學習不是好事,"There are a lot of mistakes in the teaching materials used, and I think it is not a good thing for learning",96,142,0,1,0.0001888871192932129
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0634,老師錄影片時畫質可以好一點，鏡頭不要太遠，看不清楚黑板,"The picture quality can be better when the teacher is recording the video, and the camera should not be too far away to see the blackboard clearly",99,131,0,1,0.6506630182266235
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06fb,功課量很大，上課也沒什麼收穫，因為焦點訪談還有後來的量化問卷，要自己送出抽獎品負擔有點大，希望功課量能減少，或有功課但不需要做簡報來報告也可以。,"There is a lot of homework, and there is no gain in the class. Because of the focus interview and the subsequent quantitative questionnaire, it is a bit burdensome to hand out the prizes by myself. I hope that the amount of homework can be reduced, or there is homework but there is no need to do a briefing to report.",12,690,0,3,0.0023221373558044434
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0602,在遠距之後，還要再另找場地去實際操作，對一些家裡沒有拍子或是附近沒有場地的人非常不方便，雖說可以去學校打，但並不是所有都住在台北，或有條件去借到拍子，而且所要拍攝的次數還不只一次，使得修習非常不方便．,"After a long distance, you have to find another venue to practice. It is very inconvenient for some people who don’t have a beat at home or who don’t have a venue nearby. Although they can go to school to play, not all of them live in Taipei or have the conditions to go. Borrowing the beat, and the number of shots to be taken is more than one, which makes the practice very inconvenient.",188,135,0,1,0.0012372732162475586
630cf1bb40e337e60fce065b,因為遠距改成自行錄製影片上傳，要另外找場地錄製對學生來說有點不便，感覺也沒真正清楚學到正確姿勢，無法立即調整，不過考量到疫情，可以理解是折衷的解決辦法。,"Because the distance is changed to self-recorded video upload, it is a bit inconvenient for students to find another venue to record. It feels that they have not really learned the correct posture and cannot adjust it immediately. However, considering the epidemic situation, it is understandable that it is a compromise solution.",188,135,0,1,0.0033668875694274902
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06fd,希望有考試的評分標準，可以更清楚知道該改善甚麼部分(考試都是申論題，但是理論的說明不確定要寫到甚麼程度會有一定的分數),"I hope that there are scoring standards for the exam, so that I can know more clearly what parts to improve (the exams are all application questions, but the theoretical explanation is not sure how far to write and there will be a certain score)",829,141,0,2,0.0009487271308898926
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0659,拍影片真的太累人了，遠距後學生還需要周周到球場上，外縣市的同學也不能回家。只看老師的影片很難理解該怎麼操作，對於沒有基礎的學生十分痛苦，尤其是跳發球的部分，上課還沒提到這裡，結果幾乎一半的影片都需要用到發球，我在球場上一遍一遍做著錯誤動作的時間直接超過每周兩小時的上課時程，拍作業花了我很大的心力，最後出來的成效也不如預期。然後期末作業拍攝畫角度的作業只限定IOS才能操作也很不合理，沒有顧慮到部分學生的感受，作業範例是一位左撇子同學也容易讓右撇子的人混淆該，到底怎麼填才正確,"It is really tiring to shoot videos. Students still need to be on the court carefully after distance, and students from other counties and cities cannot go home. It’s hard to understand how to operate just by watching the teacher’s videos. It’s very painful for students who don’t have the foundation, especially the part of jumping the serve. I haven’t mentioned this in class. As a result, almost half of the videos need to use the serve. I’ll do it again on the court. The time spent doing wrong movements directly exceeded the two-hour class schedule every week. It took me a lot of effort to shoot homework, and the final results were not as expected. And it’s unreasonable to only limit IOS to the homework of the final homework. I didn’t consider the feelings of some students. The example of the homework is a left-handed student, and it’s easy to confuse right-handed people. How to fill it out correctly?",188,135,0,1,0.0007421374320983887
630cf1bc40e337e60fce07aa,老師很關心學生也教得很棒，希望上課內容有更多和現實生活的連結與應用。,The teacher cares about the students and teaches well. I hope that the content of the class can be more connected and applied to real life.,99,166,0,1,0.9997180104255676

630cf1bc40e337e60fce07a1,喜歡實體上課與老師的互動，可惜最後還是遠距了,"I like the interaction between the physical class and the teacher, but it is a pity that it is still far away",99,166,0,1,0.0022085905075073242

630cf1bb40e337e60fce0674,實體上課每週都有一定運動量，每週走不同路線，能認識學校及周遭環境。遠距教學實作報告，督促大家保持運動習慣。教師課程設計用心。,"There is a certain amount of exercise every week in the physical class, and different routes are taken every week, so that you can get to know the school and the surrounding environment. The distance teaching practice report urges everyone to maintain exercise habits. Teachers' courses are carefully designed.",193,135,0,1,0.9878899455070496
630cf1bb40e337e60fce066c,老師教了很多實用的技能，上完老師的課之後覺得收穫很多，希望老師之後開健走以外的課。,"The teacher taught a lot of practical skills. After taking the teacher's class, I feel that I have gained a lot. I hope that the teacher will teach classes other than walking in the future.",193,135,0,1,0.9979786276817322
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0682,棒棒,awesome,834,137,0,2,0.9998682737350464
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06ca,三個小時上好上滿很充實。老師很認真，雖然使用中文課本還是會補充英文名詞，缺點就是課本/解答錯誤率偏高有點困擾。,"Three hours on the top is very fulfilling. The teacher is very serious. Although I use Chinese textbooks, I still add English nouns. The disadvantage is that the textbook/answer error rate is too high, which is a bit troublesome.",96,142,0,1,0.11089754104614258
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06cc,老師的授課難度適中，作業負擔也不大，非常適合和我一樣數理不太好的文組生～上課節奏也不會太快，第一次聽不是很懂也還有助教課可以複習。,"The teacher's teaching is moderately difficult, and the homework burden is not too heavy. It is very suitable for students who are not good at math and science like me. The pace of the class is not too fast. If you don't understand it at the first time, there are also teaching assistants to review.",96,142,0,1,0.9985257983207703
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0606,遠距後的作業真的太多，特別是適逢連續下雨天。,"There are really too many homework after long-distance, especially on continuous rainy days.",188,135,0,1,0.0031287074089050293
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0664,從沒有想過會接觸到港澳文學，這堂課可以認識港澳優秀的近代作家以及老師會影印文本讓我們回家閱讀。建議真的要很看熟，老師會問到很細節，但也不會太刁難！ 但是建議老師可以降低在講解港澳歷史的部分，多著重在文學，想要看更多經典作品。 整體而言，推薦學弟妹可以來修這門課,"I never thought that I would be exposed to Hong Kong and Macao literature. In this class, I can get to know outstanding modern writers in Hong Kong and Macao, and the teacher will photocopy the text for us to read at home. It is recommended to be very familiar, the teacher will ask for details, but it will not be too difficult! However, it is suggested that the teacher can reduce the part of explaining the history of Hong Kong and Macau, and focus more on literature, and want to read more classic works. Overall, I recommend younger students to take this course",835,691,0,3,0.9949083924293518

630cf1bb40e337e60fce0668,希望開放上課使用電子產品，有時候比較習慣使用電子產品做筆記。,"I hope to open up the use of electronic products in class, and sometimes I am more accustomed to using electronic products to take notes.",835,691,0,3,0.9880433082580566
630cf1bc40e337e60fce071e,希望教授可以多講述一些心理學的專業知識，減少他在生活中的領悟與個人見解，以符合學生想要學習普通心理學的期望。,"I hope that the professor can tell more about the professional knowledge of psychology and reduce his understanding and personal opinions in life, so as to meet the expectations of students who want to learn general psychology.",216,159,0,3,0.0014334321022033691
630cf1bc40e337e60fce071c,酷,cool,216,159,0,3,0.9998509883880615
630cf1bb40e337e60fce066d,這堂課培養起我的運動習慣，沒事的時候也會出去走走看看，老師上課辛苦了！,"This class has cultivated my exercise habits, and I will go out for a walk when I have nothing to do. The teacher has worked hard in class!",193,135,0,1,0.9784992933273315

630cf1bc40e337e60fce07a6,老師會舉很多實際例子，抽象觀念也會盡量具體化讓大家了解！,"The teacher will give many practical examples, and the abstract concepts will be as concrete as possible for everyone to understand!",99,166,0,1,0.9996137022972107
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06f8,老師備課不夠充足且應對各組保持中立立場，與助教討論時，助教的用詞也令人感受到他的不悅,"The teacher did not prepare enough lessons and should maintain a neutral position for each group. When discussing with the teaching assistant, the words used by the teaching assistant also made people feel his displeasure",12,690,0,3,0.0012007951736450195
630cf1bc40e337e60fce07ad,教授讚！,Professor praises!,99,166,0,1,0.9997459053993225
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0609,若是於遠距期間，應提供學生不同於實體課程的考試評量方式，而非一昧堅持使用實體器材評量分數，應提供替代方案如觀看比賽撰寫心得等，以補償無球拍且住家離學校遙遠而無法到校拍攝影片之缺憾。,"If it is during the distance period, students should be provided with an examination evaluation method different from the physical course, instead of insisting on using physical equipment to evaluate scores. Alternative solutions such as watching the game and writing their experience should be provided to compensate for the fact that there is no racket and the home is far from the school. It's a pity that I can't go to school to shoot videos because I'm far away.",188,135,0,1,0.0016030669212341309
630cf1bc40e337e60fce071b,這堂課我覺得老師可以再多上一點普通心理學的內容，讓外系的學生對普心有基本的認識,"In this class, I think the teacher can add a little more content on general psychology, so that students from other departments can have a basic understanding of general psychology",216,159,0,3,0.0051326751708984375

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0753,老師很關心學生~也很用心上課，不會負擔太大但同時也能學到東西，老師上課也會補充一些台灣的數據等等，讓經濟學更貼近生活,"The teacher cares about the students very much~ he also puts his heart into the class, he will not be burdened too much but he can learn something at the same time, the teacher will also add some Taiwan data in the class, etc., so that economics is closer to life",99,155,0,1,0.9994217157363892

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0748,老師講課很細緻，且因為是金融系老師所以有時還會偷渡一些貨銀的概念，可以很有效的幫助理解複雜觀念，整體而言超棒,"The teacher's lectures are very detailed, and because he is a teacher of the Department of Finance, he sometimes sneaks in some concepts of money and money, which can be very effective in helping to understand complex concepts. Overall, it is excellent",99,155,0,1,0.9998414516448975
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0653,往希望老師可以爭取在山下上體育課，尤其下雨天還要爬樓梯到六期太辛苦ㄌQQ,"I always hope that the teacher can try to take the physical education class at the foot of the mountain, especially on rainy days, it is too hard to climb the stairs to the sixth periodㄌQQ",188,135,0,1,0.0021182894706726074
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0632,老師上課真的很認真，也講解很多，但考試真的不是很容易，加油。 另外，老師黑板字有點太小，希望可以放大一點。 謝謝老師這一年的教導，謝謝您！,"The teacher is really serious in class and explains a lot, but the exam is really not easy, come on. In addition, the words on the teacher's blackboard are a bit too small, and I hope they can be enlarged. Thank you teacher for teaching this year, thank you!",99,131,0,1,0.015530109405517578
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0639,還是希望老師可以將板書的字寫大一點，如果能寫清楚更好,I still hope that the teacher can write the words on the blackboard a little bigger. It would be better if it can be written clearly,99,131,0,1,0.04143691062927246
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0709,老師上課講了許多他在公司的實際案例，也常常有小組討論的環節讓同學獨立思考與討論，但是正課的部分並沒有著重於管理學的理論，導致學生不太能理解課程的核心重點。,"The teacher talked about a lot of his actual cases in the company in class, and there are often group discussions for students to think and discuss independently, but the main part of the class does not focus on the theory of management, which makes students unable to understand the core points of the course.",9,147,0,1,0.011562526226043701
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0642,實體上課每講一段話會越來越小聲，到後面幾個字根本聽不清楚，學習上造成很大困擾，並且講話含糊，在講專有名詞或解釋的時候講話含糊，導致不好理解內容。老師授課時似乎認為我們都具有一些先備知識，或是覺得這些很基本，不少地方都很快帶過，講解得也不清楚。,"Every time a sentence is spoken in the physical class, the voice will become softer and softer, until the next few words cannot be heard clearly, causing great troubles in learning, and the speech is vague. When speaking of proper nouns or explanations, the speech is vague, resulting in difficulty in understanding content. When teaching, the teacher seems to think that we all have some prior knowledge, or that these are very basic, and many places are quickly covered, and the explanations are not clear.",836,128,0,1,0.00021082162857055664

630cf1bb40e337e60fce05ef,這堂課真的完全不推薦。從第一堂課開始就上好上滿，做個暖身操每週都有人昏倒，老師只會叫他們退課。老師上課講的笑話都很奇怪，總是用鄙視或嘲笑的口氣，讓人蠻不舒服的。武術動作都很尷尬又中二，學了也不能用來打架。而且每次都上到超過時間，下一堂課都很趕。,"This class is really not recommended at all. From the first class, I have a good class and do a warm-up exercise. Some people pass out every week, and the teacher will only tell them to withdraw from class. The jokes that the teacher told in class were very strange, always in a tone of contempt or ridicule, which made people quite uncomfortable. Martial arts movements are very awkward and secondary school, even if you learn it, you can't use it for fighting. And every time the time is exceeded, the next class is very rushed.",183,133,0,1,0.001400291919708252

630cf1bb40e337e60fce06a4,老師人很好～ 也常常提出問題讓我們思考，整體而言能感受到老師的認真，但覺得課程內容進度跟安排需要加強，像是報告的確切日期、課程的架構，可以更完整清楚一些，謝謝老師,"The teacher is very nice~ He often asks questions to make us think. Overall, we can feel the teacher's seriousness, but I feel that the progress and arrangement of the course content need to be strengthened, such as the exact date of the report and the structure of the course, which can be more complete and clear.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce071f,CYL老師博學多聞且歷練豐富，對於心理學以及心性學都有一番體悟，但偏重心性學。但修習這門課對於提升自我強度和與自己對話有非常大的幫助，個人覺得要修的話最好大一大二就來修，才不會有種慢別人一步知道大學要幹嘛的感覺，也更懂得自我省思和標竿學習的重要,"Teacher CYL is knowledgeable and experienced. He has some understanding of psychology and psychology, but he focuses on psychology. But taking this course is very helpful for improving self-strength and dialogue with oneself. I personally think that if you want to take it, you should take it as soon as you are a freshman or sophomore, so as not to feel like you are one step behind others in knowing what you want to do in college.

630cf1bb40e337e60fce05fd,演講安排得太緊湊且密集，相當疲勞；有些講者的民族主義心態較重，演講時能感覺到對主流社會/文化或科學的有偏見的敵意，或者談論議題時，忽視了這個議題可能是經濟結構性問題，只從族群關係的角度分析。,"Lectures are arranged too closely and densely, which is quite exhausting; some speakers have a strong nationalistic attitude, and can feel prejudiced hostility to mainstream society/culture or science when speaking, or when talking about an issue, ignoring the issue may be Economic structural issues are only analyzed from the perspective of ethnic relations.",819,132,0,3,0.0009526610374450684
630cf1bc40e337e60fce07a3,老師很認真但有時候我上課會抓不太到重點,"The teacher is very serious, but sometimes I can't grasp the key points in class",99,166,0,1,0.11618983745574951
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0785,覺得講義可以不用特地挖空格，因為老師您也常常跳著上，加上以英文表達可能沒那麼清楚，常常會讓人迷路。,"I feel that there is no need to dig out the blanks in the handouts, because you, the teacher, often jump up and down, and the English expression may not be so clear, which often makes people get lost.",792,154,3,1,0.012613475322723389
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0722,如果想學感應礦泉水，或是探討CYL的心念療法的話，那這堂課或許會很適合選修。,"If you want to learn how to sense mineral water, or discuss CYL's mind therapy, then this class may be a good choice for you.",216,159,0,3,0.9973885416984558
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0665,推推堂錡！老師就是很可愛上課很有趣，港澳是這學期第一次開的，感覺老師自己也很努力想把東西帶給大家，loading不會很重，期中是一份書面報告，然後老師發的文本他會抽問，要讀仔細！老師會詳細介紹作者，不過如果多著重在作品的賞析會更好～,"Push and push! The teacher is very cute and the class is very interesting. This is the first time for Hong Kong and Macau to open this semester. I feel that the teacher is also working hard to bring things to everyone. The loading will not be heavy. The midterm is a written report, and then the text sent by the teacher. Will ask questions, read carefully! The teacher will introduce the author in detail, but it would be better if more emphasis is placed on the appreciation of the works~",835,691,0,3,0.9967501163482666
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0663,非常推薦老師的課，選修過現代散文、現代文學史等（但好像後來交遞給新老師開了），港澳文學是新開的也很棒，老師講課有趣又內容豐富，會得到許多推薦書和認識不同作家。laoding不重，作業清楚也不難，很適合一二年級的學弟妹踏入，喜愛上中文 也請同學們尊重老師，學期一開始就說得很清楚了，實體上課時不使用電子產品。,"I highly recommend the teacher's class. I have taken modern prose, modern literature history, etc. (but it seems to be handed over to a new teacher later). Hong Kong and Macao literature is also very good. The teacher's lectures are interesting and rich in content, and I will get many recommended books and books. Get to know different writers. The laoding is not heavy, and the homework is clear and not difficult. It is very suitable for students in the first and second grades. If you like Chinese, please respect the teacher.

630cf1bb40e337e60fce0667,對於香港跟澳門的介紹在時間方面拿捏比較不一，感覺前面花太多時間在講解兩個地方的相關背景而壓縮到後面講文學的時間。但老師上課很認真，也具備豐富的知識量。,The introduction of Hong Kong and Macau is different in terms of timing. I feel that too much time is spent on explaining the background of the two places and the time on literature is compressed later. But the teacher is very serious in class and has a wealth of knowledge.,835,691,0,3,0.9987824559211731
630cf1bb40e337e60fce06d6,上課速度太快，還是希望老師能把課本上的公式都盡可能證明過一次，而不是直接帶過，我認為證明有助於理解公式並更容易記憶。,"The class is too fast, and I still hope that the teacher can prove all the formulas in the textbook as much as possible, instead of taking them directly. I think the proof will help understand the formulas and make them easier to remember.",96,142,0,1,0.0019878149032592773
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0798,老師上課講解得非常詳細，能夠恨快的理解，但有些圖表可以換成較近年的，也希望老師可以提早一點上傳講義讓我們有更多時間可以準備,"The teacher explained in detail in the class, and I can understand it quickly, but some charts can be replaced with more recent ones. I also hope that the teacher can upload the lecture notes earlier so that we have more time to prepare",212,155,0,3,0.0015208125114440918

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0742,雖然老師是第一次教經濟學，但教得很好，講話慢條斯理的! 也把經濟學的基本知識講的很清楚明瞭! 是很推薦上的一門課!,"Although the teacher is teaching economics for the first time, he teaches very well and speaks slowly! He also explains the basic knowledge of economics very clearly! It is a highly recommended course!",99,155,0,1,0.999775230884552

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0721,其實老師很認真備課！但是要跟老師接上頻率應該才能真正理解老師真正想表達什麼。,"In fact, the teacher prepares lessons very seriously! But you have to get in touch with the teacher in order to truly understand what the teacher really wants to express.",216,159,0,3,0.9960173964500427
630cf1bc40e337e60fce074e,雖然是老師第一次教經濟學，但PPT內容豐富，也常補充時事和應用，覺得學到很多，學習起來也不會無聊。,"Although it is the first time for the teacher to teach economics, the PPT is rich in content and often adds current events and applications. I feel that I have learned a lot and will not be bored while studying.",99,155,0,1,0.9996616840362549
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0662,老師網課可以考慮webex，畫質比googlemeet好，很好操作，還可以小組討論，視訊也不會斷斷續續的,"Teachers can consider webex for online classes, the picture quality is better than googlemeet, it is easy to operate, you can also discuss in groups, and the video will not be intermittent",835,691,0,3,0.9901973009109497
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0655,老師人滿好的，對每個同學的學習狀況都很關心，但是遠距授課之後，要同學自己找到球場拍影片實在有點強人所難....,"The teachers are very good, and they are very concerned about the learning status of each student, but after distance teaching, it is a bit difficult for students to find the stadium to shoot videos....",188,135,0,1,0.019919633865356445

630cf1bb40e337e60fce0683,希望老師不要在回答學生問題時，都用閃躲的，不然就是講些模糊的東西,"I hope the teacher will not use dodge when answering students' questions, or he will just say something vague",834,137,0,2,0.00035202503204345703
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0745,老師線上上課的效率比實體好，因為線上上課可以重複回放。 老師很厲害，會用很清楚的架構與舉例讓我們了解經濟學理論的內容，每次上課都可以很清楚、快速明白課本的內容。 而且老師也會適時更新時事，也對同學很好，是個親切又會教學的老師～,"The efficiency of the teacher's online class is better than that of the physical, because the online class can be played back repeatedly. The teacher is very good. He will use a very clear structure and examples to let us understand the content of economic theory.

630cf1bb40e337e60fce0681,超級喜歡老師的教學，學到很多，雖然尼采真的很難，但透過老師的解說引起了我很大很大的興趣，讓我願意花更多時間去探索此課程的更多延伸，並更喜歡哲學,"I really like the teacher's teaching and learned a lot. Although Nietzsche is really difficult, the teacher's explanation has aroused my great interest, and I am willing to spend more time to explore more extensions of this course, and more like philosophy",834,137,0,2,0.9925428628921509
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0647,老師講解得很好、很詳細，也常常補充科技業的時事讓我們知道，但是可以稍微再放慢一點速度或是一些重要的觀念可以重複說幾次（在同一堂課中），不然某幾堂課吸收效率不是很佳,"The teacher explained very well and in detail, and often added current events in the technology industry to let us know, but the speed can be slowed down a little bit or some important concepts can be repeated several times (in the same class), otherwise some The class absorption efficiency is not very good",836,128,0,1,0.000859379768371582
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0790,這堂課實體上課時我都能理解老師想要表達的內容，但是遠距後的上課方式有點難以吸收，老師都會事先將筆記內容先寫好，我們必須暫停影片抄筆記，要不然會來不及，整體上課時間基本都會超過三小時，就算沒有暫停，有些周次的課程時常其實也超過150分鐘了，沒有考慮到學生負荷，實體跟遠距之間的課程內容平衡也沒有調整好，最後考試的負荷量也大。,"I can understand what the teacher wants to express during this class, but the way of teaching after a distance is a bit difficult to absorb. The teacher will write the notes in advance. We have to pause the video to copy the notes, otherwise it will be too late. The overall class time will basically exceed three hours. Even if there is no suspension, some weekly courses often exceed 150 minutes. The student load is not considered, and the balance of course content between physical and distance courses has not been adjusted.

630cf1bb40e337e60fce0648,老師講得很詳細。有點小建議是希望可以加大上課音量，可能3301的麥克風設備不優吧，老師講到一半會變很小聲，聽得有點吃力、常常聽不太清楚QQ，但遠距後就改善很多了。,"The teacher explained it in great detail. A little suggestion is that I hope to increase the volume in class. Maybe the microphone equipment of 3301 is not good. The teacher will become very quiet in the middle of the speech.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0778,老師人很客氣、對學生很親切，講話也蠻好笑的。這門課的內容算有點硬，老師會針對大家報告提不少建議，但我覺得內容很紮實，評分方式也不會太刁難，是很棒的課!,"The teachers are very polite, kind to the students, and their speeches are quite funny. The content of this course is a bit hard, and the teacher will give you a lot of suggestions for everyone's report, but I think the content is very solid, and the grading method is not too difficult. It is a great class!",837,154,0,2,0.9996048808097839
630cf1bb40e337e60fce0621,我覺得老師博學多聞，認真聽課可以學到很多知識，但是課堂中感覺比較沒有連貫，講課感覺是跳躍式的，有時候會跟不太上，不過有可能是我資質駑鈍啦。,"I think the teacher is knowledgeable and knowledgeable, and I can learn a lot of knowledge by listening carefully to the class, but the class feels less coherent, the lecture feels jumpy, and sometimes I can't keep up, but it may be that my qualifications are blunt.",182,132,0,1,0.0020951032638549805

The subject matter of the group report gave me the opportunity to absorb diverse knowledge, praise. Auditing is really a subject that has no practical experience.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0809,考試有點難，因為是中英混雜，在剛開始接觸觀念，還無法活用理解內容的情況下，情境式的答題真的有點太難，希望老師可以在上課和考試可以再減少英文,"The exam is a bit difficult, because it is a mix of Chinese and English. When I just started to get in touch with concepts and can’t understand the content, the situational answering questions are really too difficult.

In addition to the knowledge of financial holdings, I can also learn the ability to analyze current events and verbal expression.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce07ec,針對一門選修課我認為本課程作業量有點難以負荷，總是需要花超出預計的時間去應對每次的內容，長久以來，許會降低學生學習的慾望，強制的課程討論也比較難達成良好的成效。,"For an elective course, I think the workload of this course is a bit overwhelming. It always takes more than expected time to deal with each content. For a long time, it may reduce students' desire to learn, and it is difficult to achieve good results through compulsory course discussions. effectiveness.",842,160,0,3,0.010488808155059814

630cf1bc40e337e60fce08b0,這堂課很優~ 如果是較低年級的人來上可以讓你擴展金控相關行業的視野，較高年級的人可以更加應用所學及說話能力，也可以更拓展知識。這堂課非常適合全心全意的投入，因為這學期我課比較多所以上這堂課的時候沒有很有精神，真的很對不起老師跟自己，所以對這點的感受更加深刻，常常會覺得如果自己有辦法更認真上課就好了...這堂課的知識及趣味性都很值得大家投入不少心力，而且老師一定會給大家反饋的，推薦!,"This class is excellent~ If you come from a lower grade, it will allow you to expand your horizons in financial holding related industries, and higher grades can apply what you have learned and speaking skills, and you can also expand your knowledge. This class is very suitable for wholehearted devotion, because I have a lot of classes this semester, so I was not very energetic when I took this class. I am really sorry for the teacher and myself, so I feel more deeply about this, and I often feel that if I It would be great if there is a way to take the class more seriously...

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0857,希望可以多一點計算與過程推導，畢竟wooldridge的課本內容過於繁瑣，僅僅就是簡單帶過一些計量的檢定方法、以及假設等等，有時會讓我不太了解這個東西到底要幹嘛用。但老師教得很好，對學生也很nice，謝謝老師。,"I hope that there can be more calculations and process derivations.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce082c,我太喜歡小麥了，這學期最喜歡的課，讓我的Adobe技能更上一層樓，好開心能在學校上到教Adobe軟體的課，由於系上的課較少著重於技術性成長，修到這堂課真的讓我奠定基本功，希望老師往後可以開設更多Adobe系列課程，像是Ai、Id，我一定會繼續修習！老師上課幽默風趣，跟學生互動良好，就算是教授較艱澀的程式設計，還是能讓同學目不轉睛專心上課，只可惜受限上課時數限制，想要更深入一些軟體，但隨即就進入課程的下一階段，且改成線上後無法實體上課真的好難過，拜託老師之後開設更多課程，愛你,"I like wheat so much. My favorite class this semester has improved my Adobe skills to a higher level. I am so happy to be able to teach Adobe software in school. Since the courses in the department are less focused on technical growth, the course This class really helped me to lay the basic skills. I hope that the teacher can offer more Adobe series courses in the future, such as Ai and Id. I will definitely continue to study! The teacher is humorous and funny in class, and interacts well with the students. Even if he is teaching more difficult programming, he can still keep the students' attention on the class. Unfortunately, due to the limited number of class hours, he wants to go deeper into some software, but then enters the next part of the class.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce089f,兩位初級會計學的老師都讓我獲益良多，在課程安排上都非常合理、用心，謝謝兩位老師的認真教學。,"I have benefited a lot from the two elementary accounting teachers, and they are very reasonable and attentive in the course arrangement. Thank you for the serious teaching of the two teachers.",2,174,3,1,0.9997947812080383
630cf1bc40e337e60fce095c,老師上課講解的非常詳細，而且基本動作教的很扎實，揮空拍的時間也足夠，我以前學的動作都有改進很多。但是老師講解的時間有些拖，感覺可以再挪一些時間去一邊講解一邊揮空拍，而不是我們坐在地上聽老師講解20～30分鐘，跟搭檔練習只有40分鐘左右我覺得不太夠，老師的教法感覺比較適合小學階段的學生，畢竟大學生比較沒有課堂外的時間去練習。老師的教法對於初階的同學來說真的很容易上手喔。,"The teacher explained in detail in the class, and the basic movements were taught solidly, and there was enough time for swinging and shooting. The movements I learned before have improved a lot. But the time for the teacher to explain is a bit delayed. I feel that we can take some more time to explain and shoot at the same time, instead of sitting on the ground and listening to the teacher for 20-30 minutes, and practicing with our partners for only about 40 minutes. I think it is not enough, teacher I feel that the teaching method is more suitable for primary school students, after all, college students have less time to practice outside of class. The teacher's teaching method is really easy for beginners.",236,179,0,1,0.022966206073760986
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0963,希望老師能多下場關心同學的學習狀況，有時候只跟單一同學進行教學。上課以兩兩一組練習，很難針對盲點更正。,"I hope that the teacher can pay more attention to the learning status of the students, and sometimes only teach with a single student. In class, practice in groups of two and two, and it is difficult to correct for blind spots.",236,179,0,1,0.0009868144989013672
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0931,期中考的範圍相當廣，準備的很辛苦，好險期中考內容不太困難，謝謝老師。加分的部分稍嫌不清楚，因為同步與非同步遠距皆可參與，但有時候老師說加分題是10分鐘搶答，不曉得最終加分的原則為何。,"The scope of the midterm exam is quite wide, and the preparation is very hard. Fortunately, the content of the midterm exam is not too difficult, thank you teacher. The extra points are a little unclear, because both synchronous and asynchronous remote participants can participate, but sometimes the teacher says that the extra points are answered in 10 minutes, and I don’t know the principle of the final extra points.",212,178,0,2,0.009848833084106445

630cf1bc40e337e60fce09a4,1.老師所說的增加學生思考，希望不是只體現在考試題目上，真的想要大家思考是不是平常也可以出一些作業讓大家回去想想看，課堂進行跟別堂課一樣，只有寫期中期末的考卷會開始思考好像不符老師提到的教學目標 2.老師的題目可以不要太為難文組嗎~大家並不知道光電板排出的水跟拖把水一樣 3.可不可以對大四手下留情一下...還要修第3次很心累...而且並不是年級讀得越高就理應寫得比低年級的好，系上課程多學幾年根本沒多學到什麼東西。再說，同屆的系上卷哥卷姐都可以被老師當了，老師太狠了...,"1. What the teacher said about increasing students' thinking, I hope it is not only reflected in the test questions. I really want everyone to think about whether it is normal to give some homework for everyone to go back and think about it. The class is the same as other classes, only writing The exam papers at the end of the mid-term will start to think that it doesn’t match the teaching objectives mentioned by the teacher 2. Can the teacher’s questions not be too embarrassing for the essay group? Everyone doesn’t know that the water discharged by the photoelectric panel is the same as the water from a mop 3. Can you be merciful to the seniors? It's tiring to take the third time... and it doesn't mean that the higher the grade is, the better the writing is than the lower grades. I didn't learn much at all after taking courses for a few years. Besides, the elder brother and sister Juan in the same department can be taken by the teacher, the teacher is too ruthless...",844,177,0,1,0.0012717843055725098
630cf1bc40e337e60fce09a8,真的花非常多的時間在準備，但依然沒有理想的結果，像我這樣的學生挫折感很重,"It really takes a lot of time to prepare, but there is still no ideal result. Students like me feel a lot of frustration",844,177,0,1,0.0006017684936523438

630cf1bc40e337e60fce08b2,老師上課時都會過於灌輸個人意見，對於社會議題與社會案件很有自己的意見與想法固然很好，但每週上課都有ㄧ至一個半小時都在講授類似的或是甚至相同的故事，不但難以吸引人，更顯得好像是老師一昧的灌輸自己的想法而已。認為老師應該要顧及一下上課情形，不然每週都有好一大段時間都會有點偏題、抽離課程，如果老師想一直強調自己的論點，應該要給出夠多的論證觀點以及學說，否則會顯得課程很冗長乏味。,"Teachers always instill personal opinions in class. It is good to have their own opinions and ideas on social issues and social cases, but there are 1 to 1.5 hours of teaching similar or even the same stories in class every week. It's hard to attract people, and it seems that the teacher just instilled his own ideas. I think the teacher should take the class situation into consideration, otherwise there will be a long period of time every week. If the teacher wants to always emphasize his argument, he should give enough arguments and theories, otherwise he will The course seems to be long and boring.",840,692,0,1,0.00026351213455200195

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0821,沒想到老師這麼年輕，可愛又活潑，雖然是僑生但是因為在別的國家長大，所以在接受語言方面跟不上本地人的速度，所以有點跟不上課程，這是我自己的問題啦，其他同學經過老師的指導下都做的很好～,"I didn't expect the teacher to be so young, cute and lively. Although I am an overseas Chinese student, I grew up in another country, so I can't keep up with the locals in terms of language acceptance, so I can't keep up with the courses.

For the description of the model, the teacher can always use different angles and stories to encourage students to understand concepts with very simple logic, instead of taking relatively difficult ones.

630cf1bb40e337e60fce061f,希望助教課程的內容可以更加深入，作業內容亦可多加斟酌，加深難度、減少作業量，避免出現重複性高的題目，方能提升學習成效。,"It is hoped that the content of teaching assistant courses can be more in-depth, and the content of homework can also be more carefully considered to increase the difficulty, reduce the amount of homework, and avoid repetitive questions, so as to improve the learning effect.",182,132,0,1,0.0165938138961792

630cf1bc40e337e60fce08ad,金隆老師於業界歷練豐富，於課堂上講課行雲流水，能引發同學的好奇，時常點同學發言避免其發呆，也經常鼓勵同學思考，課後也會有很多報告與實事分析的指派，loading重，但是得到(真的用的到)的東西也很多，大腦需要迅速運轉，但是老師上課跟考試是不落俗套的，在這麼猛烈的課程安排中，常常會有一些有趣的小活動或是老師的經驗談，就像苦口的良藥用糖衣包裹著一般，讓人較好入口 ;) 老師超級讚的!,"Teacher Jin Long has rich experience in the industry, and his lectures are smooth and smooth in the classroom, which can arouse the curiosity of the students. He often asks the students to speak to avoid their daze, and often encourages the students to think. After class, there will be many reports and practical analysis assignments. But there are a lot of things to get (really use them), and the brain needs to work quickly, but the teacher's class and exams are not out of the ordinary. In such a violent curriculum schedule, there are often some interesting little activities or teacher's ideas. Speaking from experience, it's like a bitter medicine wrapped in sugar, making it easier for people to eat;) The teacher is super awesome!",839,170,0,3,0.9971039891242981
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0900,老師教學極為認真、課程扎實，自編講義邏輯清楚、助於學習。雖然作業改的有點嚴格，但能修到老師的課非常有收穫。,"The teacher is very serious in teaching, the courses are solid, and the self-compiled handouts are logical and helpful for learning. Although the homework revision is a bit strict, it is very rewarding to be able to take the teacher's class.",239,182,0,1,0.9998633861541748
630cf1bc40e337e60fce08c1,老師很用心上課，也會跟同學分享社會上正在發生的抗爭事件等等，學到了很多！,"The teacher is very attentive in class, and will also share with the students the protests that are happening in the society, etc., and I have learned a lot!",840,692,0,1,0.9996325969696045

630cf1bc40e337e60fce08e6,我覺得目前都很棒 希望老師繼續保持,"I think everything is great so far, I hope the teacher will continue to maintain it",846,171,0,2,0.9998576641082764
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0880,建議兩次考試範圍可以平均一點，不然期末考會負擔太重,"It is recommended that the scope of the two exams can be averaged, otherwise the final exam will be too burdensome",448,175,0,1,0.00183945894241333
630cf1bc40e337e60fce085b,建議老師錄製R的教學影片讓學生課後觀看，否則全組都不會R，事情等丟給我做，壓力會很大,"It is recommended that the teacher record R teaching videos for students to watch after class, otherwise the whole group will not know R, and the things will be left to me, and the pressure will be great",843,191,0,3,0.0023429393768310547
630cf1bc40e337e60fce085f,老師很用心授課，實體上課時，板書很完整，老師也會一步步說明模型的假說與細節，並很用心回答學生的問題。然而，遠距上課後，老師上課的節奏太快，比較難吸收課程重點。因此，我比較喜歡實體授課，如果是線上上課，建議老師能夠搭配線上白板功能進行教學。,"The teacher is very attentive in teaching. During the physical class, the writing on the blackboard is very complete. The teacher will also explain the hypothesis and details of the model step by step, and answer students' questions with great care. However, after taking classes remotely, the pace of the teacher's class is too fast, making it difficult to absorb the key points of the course. Therefore, I prefer physical teaching. If it is an online class, it is recommended that the teacher can use the online whiteboard function for teaching.",843,191,0,3,0.011922717094421387
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0960,希望可以多在學生練習時調整學生的動作，或是給予指導。群體練習或集體依老師口令做動作時，未必會出現學生練習時出現的動作變形，故若能多在學生練習時進行修正與指導，對學生的幫助會更大。,"I hope that I can adjust the students' movements or give guidance during the students' practice. When doing group practice or doing movements according to the teacher's password, there may not be movement deformation that occurs during the student's practice. Therefore, if more corrections and guidance can be made during the student's practice, it will be more helpful to the students.",236,179,0,1,0.009809136390686035
630cf1bc40e337e60fce092c,我覺得老師真的很棒 尤其是在課程上會錄影這塊 給學生很好的機會能夠複習上課所學的內容 講課也很清楚 很多別堂課我沒有聽懂的觀念都是從老師這堂課學會的,"I think the teacher is really great, especially the video recording in the class, which gives students a good opportunity to review what they have learned in the class. The lectures are also very clear. Many concepts that I did not understand in other classes are all from the teacher's class. Learned",212,178,0,2,0.9997772574424744
630cf1bc40e337e60fce08ed,如果ppt的內容只是把課本照抄的話，至少附個頁數或是小標 每次都翻到破頭才找到，結果什麼都沒聽到就換下一個主題了。,"If the content of the ppt is just copied from the textbook, at least attach a page number or a small mark. Every time I turn to the bottom to find it, but I don’t hear anything and change the topic.",231,172,3,1,0.0006177425384521484
630cf1bc40e337e60fce09a7,希望老師掌握課程進度，別讓考試一延再延。,I hope that the teacher will keep abreast of the progress of the course and not let the exam be postponed again and again.,844,177,0,1,0.9986586570739746

630cf1bc40e337e60fce07e9,我覺得老師的課程安排很妥當，課程裡安排電影欣賞和講座讓整個課程變得豐富起來。而且經由這堂課讓我更深入去了解基礎政府運作機制，也引起我對公部門還有公共議題的興趣。建議如果課堂中可以嘗試加入角色扮演的環節會更生動有趣喔！,"I think the teacher's course arrangement is very appropriate. Movie appreciation and lectures are arranged in the course to enrich the whole course. And through this class, I have a deeper understanding of the basic government operation mechanism, and it also arouses my interest in the public sector and public issues. It is suggested that if you can try to add role-playing sessions in the classroom, it will be more lively and interesting!",842,160,0,3,0.9992446899414062

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0830,老師非常有耐心手把手教學，而且作業難度也不會為難學生，況且我覺得老師教的內容、安排的課綱真的非常實用。 除了每一堂課的課後回饋，在每一個軟體的教學結束之後，老師都會讓我們自我打分，並且對下一個軟體學習預估自己的能力以及想學習的內容。對於這一點，我覺得老師真的很用心實行「因材施教」這一點，非常盡責。 此外，老師還很擅於炒熱氣氛，並把整個上課的氛圍營造得非常愉悅、輕鬆。 這堂課真的收穫滿滿！,"The teacher is very patient and hands-on teaching, and the difficulty of the homework will not embarrass the students. Besides, I think the content taught by the teacher and the syllabus arranged by the teacher are really practical. In addition to the after-class feedback for each class, after each software teaching, the teacher will ask us to score ourselves, and predict our ability and what we want to learn about the next software learning. Regarding this point, I think the teacher really puts his heart into ""teaching students in accordance with their aptitude"" and is very responsible. In addition, the teacher is very good at stirring up the atmosphere and making the whole class atmosphere very pleasant and relaxed. This class was really rewarding!",210,153,0,3,0.9995298385620117

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0872,很喜歡老師上課時總是鼓勵學生回答問題或是發言，覺得有幫助我更了解課程內容，不過很可惜實體課很少,"I really like that the teacher always encourages students to answer questions or make speeches during class. I think it helps me understand the course content better, but it is a pity that there are very few physical classes",841,174,3,1,0.11664354801177979
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0815,老師上課有趣，與學生有良好的互動。每周都會讓同學填寫教學意見回饋，並根據上周回饋的內容改進教學。,"The teachers are interesting and interact well with the students. Every week, students are asked to fill in their teaching feedback and improve the teaching based on the content of the feedback last week.",210,153,0,3,0.9997995495796204
630cf1bc40e337e60fce08b3,老師對土地人權與居住正義的熱情跟信念很令人動容，雖然遭遇很多挫折，但感受的到老師依然對土地政策的發展投入很多心力，這門課程能很大程度建構知識的另一面向，收穫良多！,"The teacher's enthusiasm and belief in land rights and housing justice are very moving. Although he has encountered many setbacks, he still feels that the teacher still puts a lot of effort into the development of land policies.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce076e,老師的課程非常紮實，作業和報告也都需要花一些時間完成，甚至連助教課的內容都非常豐富。雖然負擔比較重，但是上完老師的課真的會學到很多。另外，雖然這學期的報告依舊很多，但我覺得這學期的報告內容比較有趣，做起來很快樂。,"The teacher's curriculum is very solid, and the assignments and reports also take some time to complete, and even the content of the teaching assistant's class is very rich. Although the burden is relatively heavy, you will really learn a lot after taking the teacher's class.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0769,鎧如老師在課程規劃上很用心，尤其特別喜歡本學期的提案競賽，且平時課堂上老師在講述專業知識時都很清楚，同時課後也十分關心學生的狀況！不過作業份量上真的偏多，但確實能一定程度地透過作業活用上課知識，且助教及老師都會給予很多回饋和修改建議，在每次的討論和修改中都學到很多。整體而言本課很扎實，但仍建議外系同學若要修習，一定要衡量課業量是否得以負擔，且對行政學是否真有足夠興趣。最後謝謝老師本學期的指導！辛苦了~,"Teacher Kairu is very attentive in curriculum planning, and especially likes the proposal competition this semester, and the teacher is very clear when explaining professional knowledge in class, and at the same time, he is also very concerned about the situation of students after class! However, the amount of homework is really too much, but the knowledge in class can be used to a certain extent through the homework, and the teaching assistants and teachers will give a lot of feedback and suggestions for revision, and I learn a lot in every discussion and revision. Overall, this course is very solid, but it is still recommended that if students from other departments want to take it, they must measure whether the workload can be afforded and whether they are really interested in public administration. Finally, thank you teacher for your guidance this semester! hard work~",217,160,0,1,0.9988436698913574
630cf1bc40e337e60fce07d7,興華老師上課超認真，幽默有趣不枯燥，而且深入淺出，非常喜歡老師常常舉很生活化的例子讓大家思考一下，再開始深入講解，而且為了怕大家上課環境不佳，還特地拿了攝影器材每節課錄影；又發現上課寫白板的字跡在影片中不明顯，還自費買了很貴的超粗白板筆，讓同學的線上課程也能跟實體上課有一樣的效果，老師超棒!,"Teacher Xinghua is very serious in class, humorous and interesting, not boring, and easy to understand. I really like that the teacher often gives very life-like examples for everyone to think about before starting to explain in depth. In order to prevent everyone from having a bad class environment, he also specially took photography equipment every day. I recorded a class video; I also found that the writing on the whiteboard in class was not obvious in the video, and I bought a very expensive ultra-thick whiteboard marker at my own expense, so that the online class of the students can have the same effect as the physical class. The teacher is great!",838,155,0,3,0.9926803112030029
630cf1bc40e337e60fce07fc,每次有問題問老師，老師都會很詳細地講解，有時候還會補充很多其他延伸語法，賺到！,"Every time I have a question and ask the teacher, the teacher will explain it in detail, and sometimes add a lot of other extended grammar, earn money!",78,146,0,1,0.9576897025108337

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0881,老師人很好，有一個年齡與我們相近的女兒（？），真的很樂意解答我們的問題 授課方面，老師的ppt都會更新成最新的公報，所以不怕讀到舊的內容。不過在講授的口條上，不確定是因為準則較瑣碎還是如何，感覺時常照著ppt唸過很長的公報條文，之後又繞回相同的東西、常常聽一聽覺得是重複的內容@@ 想要在此感謝一下廖助教，真的是我看過最認真、幾乎跟我們一樣重新上課一遍、整理出筆記給我們、助教課也教得淺顯易懂的助教！！（不知道為什麼助教評鑑那邊沒有，所以只好在這邊留言><）,"The teacher is very nice and has a daughter (?) who is similar in age to us. She is really happy to answer our questions. In terms of teaching, the teacher's ppt will be updated with the latest bulletin, so I am not afraid to read the old content. However, I’m not sure whether it’s because the guidelines are too trivial or what. I often read the long bulletin articles according to the ppt, and then go back to the same thing. I often listen to the content that I think is repetitive @@ I would like to thank Teaching Assistant Liao. He is the most serious teaching assistant I have ever seen. He re-takes the class almost like us, sorts out the notes for us, and teaches the teaching assistants in an easy-to-understand way! ! (I don’t know why there is no teaching assistant evaluation, so I have to leave a message here><)",448,175,0,1,0.8778398036956787

Super push ❤️‍🔥 Teacher Mai is serious about teaching, although there may be a lot of homework, but with homework, you can also review what you have learned and check your own learning status!

630cf1bc40e337e60fce087b,謝謝老師這學期的付出，幫助我們建立紮實的審計學基礎，雖然審計學需要投入很多的時間與心力才能有所回報，但耐心消化完課程所學後真的會很滿足，老師辛苦了！,"Thank you teacher for your hard work this semester, helping us build a solid auditing foundation.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0812,老師上課方式幽默風趣，很喜歡老師上課的節奏，不過一旦沒跟上或一時分心，就會落下一大拍，上課節奏可能需要調整一下！不過老師很讚～學到很多。,"The teacher's class is humorous and funny. I really like the rhythm of the teacher's class, but if you don't keep up or get distracted for a while, it will be a big hit. The class rhythm may need to be adjusted!

630cf1bc40e337e60fce087a,這堂課最辛苦的就是要一直背，原本覺得老師考有點多要背公報的題目，但習慣後就覺得其實還好，老師跟助教也會強調某些內容，不會讓自己在背時毫無頭緒的亂背然後忘一堆，另外，老師跟助教上課都上的很好!因為我是理解能力較差的普通人，雖然一開始不太適應，但幾堂課後就覺得還好~老師的笑聲超好笑，時不時的關心也會讓人有讀下去的動力!雖然上課時間還滿長的，甚至還有助教課補課或是助教課要上，但老師及助教都上的很好所以不會覺得浪費時間~而且上完審計後能在各科目都能更瞭解財報上的專有名詞，很值得。,"The hardest part of this class is to keep memorizing. At first, I thought the teacher had to memorize a lot of communiqué questions, but after I got used to it, I felt that it was actually okay. The teacher and teaching assistants would also emphasize certain content, so that I would not let myself be at a loss when memorizing. Memorize without clues and forget a lot. In addition, the teacher and teaching assistants are very good in class! Because I am an ordinary person with poor comprehension ability, although I am not used to it at first, but after a few classes, I feel fine~ Teacher The laughter is super funny, and the caring from time to time will also motivate people to read! Although the class time is still long, and there are even make-up classes for teaching assistants or teaching assistants, but the teachers and teaching assistants are doing very well. I don’t think it’s a waste of time~ and after the audit, I can learn more about the proper nouns in the financial report in various subjects, which is very worthwhile.",448,175,0,1,0.9966692328453064
630cf1bc40e337e60fce081d,老師都會確認同學是否上課都有跟上，並且很樂於解答學生的問題，也都會根據學生想學習的都吸調整上課內容，老師上課真的非常用心。我覺得這學期學到的內容都非常實用，謝謝老師這學期辛苦的教學！,"The teacher will confirm whether the students have followed the class, and is happy to answer students' questions.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce095d,每次上完這堂課都覺得收穫滿滿，可以感覺到老師授課很用心，而且從零開始教，也都不厭其煩帶我們練空拍，希望我們可以打好羽球的基礎，對於體育很爛的我都可以感受到自己有所進步。唯一一個小小建議，希望老師在讓我們自己跟組員練習的時候，可以多多走到後面去看學生的練習情況，讓我們知道在實際練習的時候如果打不好的話問題出在哪裡。,"Every time I finish this class, I feel that I have gained a lot. I can feel that the teacher is very attentive in teaching, and he taught us from scratch, and he took the trouble to take us to practice aerial shooting. I hope we can lay a good foundation in badminton. For those who are bad at sports I can feel myself improving. The only small suggestion is that I hope that when the teacher asks us to practice with the group members, he can go to the back to watch the students' practice, so that we can know what the problem is if we can't play well during the actual practice.",236,179,0,1,0.9120216369628906
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0904,不要加太多中會，要上不上的又不一定會考，讓我們準備考試準備的很辛苦，然後作業太多占用一大堆時間,"Don’t add too many high school exams, if you don’t pass the exam, you may not be able to take the exam, let us prepare for the exam very hard, and then too much homework takes up a lot of time",764,176,0,1,0.0005497336387634277

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0906,我認為這堂課以初會課來說負擔有點太重了，好似六學分而非三學分的課。每個禮拜幾乎都有兩三份作業要交，包括了從資料庫找資料並彙整、比較的作業，對眼睛很不友善，也很耗時，甚至是在期中考當天要繳交，大大壓縮了讀書的時間。雖然因遠距取消了期末考，但每周都有一堆作業要交，實在讓人有點吃不消，而分數的調配我認為也需要調整。 投影片的內容繁複難以理解，本來應該是較輕鬆愉快的入門初會，但補充了過多的東西，包括中會的內容等，感覺補充的內容都快比正課的內容要多了，望之後能有所調整。謝謝教授。,"I think this class is a bit too heavy for an introductory class, like a six-credit class instead of a three-credit class. There are almost two or three assignments to be handed in every week, including searching for information from the database, compiling, and comparing assignments. It is not friendly to the eyes, and it is also time-consuming. It is even handed in on the day of the midterm exam, which greatly reduces the workload. time for reading. Although the final exam was canceled due to distance, there are a lot of homework to be handed in every week, which is a bit overwhelming, and I think the allocation of scores also needs to be adjusted. The content of the slideshow is complicated and difficult to understand. It should have been a more relaxed and pleasant introductory meeting, but too many things have been added, including the content of the second meeting. I feel that the supplementary content is almost more than the content of the main class. Adjusted. Thank you professor.",764,176,0,1,0.0008503198623657227
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0922,我覺得老師很為學生著想，教學的方式也還不錯，可以學到挺多的知識。,"I think the teacher is very considerate of the students, the way of teaching is not bad, and I can learn a lot of knowledge.",212,178,0,2,0.9990140199661255
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0985,希望能夠增加實際練習、討論的機會，畢竟理論之學習容易流於抽象，比較不好掌握! 謝謝老師，辛苦了~,"I hope to increase the opportunities for practical practice and discussion.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0806,老師很可愛很親切也很認真，只是希望老師可以告訴我們哪些部分是需要記的....因為有時候不是不願意讀只是抓不太到哪些地方需要全部記起來...,"The teacher is very cute, kind and serious.

For example, I feel that my oral pronounciation is very bad, but the teacher will find good parts to praise, which makes me more confident and willing to speak.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0779,老師人超認真，可以聽出來老師是有充分備課的，除了有詳盡的保母級數學推導，也會帶程式範例，兼具理論與實務。考試、作業、報告的要求十分明確，分數也都給的很大方。 課程唯一可惜的地方是花太多時間在小組報告上，導致壓縮到GARCH、SV、VAR等模型的介紹，或許可以考慮取消期中口頭報告，改成書面繳交，因為大部分的組別在期末報告的時候都會重講一次期中報告的內容。或是強制改成4人一組，以減少一半的組數。 最後謝謝老師這學期的教導，這是一門非常棒的課！,"The teacher is super serious, and it can be heard that the teacher has fully prepared lessons. In addition to detailed nanny-level mathematical derivation, there will also be program examples, which combine theory and practice. The requirements for exams, assignments, and reports are very clear, and the scores are generously given. The only pity of the course is that too much time is spent on group reports, which leads to the introduction of GARCH, SV, VAR and other models. Maybe you can consider canceling the mid-term oral report and submitting it in writing, because most of the groups are at the end of the term. During the report, the content of the mid-term report will be revisited. Or force a group of 4 to cut the number of sets in half. Finally, thank you teacher for teaching this semester, this is a great class!",837,154,0,2,0.9961252808570862
630cf1bc40e337e60fce077f,老師真的教很好，每堂課都能感受到老師的認真與用心，應該是這三年來在統計系本系遇到最喜歡的教授。一開始感覺這堂課很難，但老師深入淺出的教學方式，都滿容易理解的。另外，我認為老師期中考出的很好，不至於到不讀書背答案也能考好的那種甜涼考試，但是考試內容絕對是和上課相關！有認真讀筆記或是寫作業一定會！做報告雖然有點碰壁，老師對報告也有較高的要求，不過至少到期中報告為止，分數都讓人滿意（老師表示鼓勵性質XD），但希望能和老師本人能多點交流，這樣才能更了解老師對報告的具體期待。,"The teacher is really good at teaching, and you can feel the seriousness and dedication of the teacher in every class. It should be the favorite professor I met in the Department of Statistics in the past three years. At the beginning, I felt that this class was difficult, but the teacher's teaching method was very easy to understand. In addition, I think the teacher did a good job in the mid-term exam. It is not a sweet exam that you can pass without reading and memorizing the answers, but the content of the exam is definitely related to the class! If you read your notes carefully or do your homework, you will definitely! Although the report is a bit of a wall, the teacher also has high requirements for the report, but at least until the mid-term report, the scores are satisfactory (the teacher said that it is encouraging XD), but I hope to communicate with the teacher himself more, so that I can be better Find out what the teacher specifically expects from the report.",837,154,0,2,0.9939759373664856

It's just that the homework is a bit heavy, but it allows me to understand the content of the law better.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce07e0,建議老師可以在上課帶一些類似期中期末的題目，讓我們在考試時不會那麼手足無措,"It is suggested that the teacher can bring some questions similar to the midterm and final in class, so that we will not be so at a loss during the exam",838,155,0,3,0.008587121963500977

At first I found it really difficult, but I gradually found the trick and gradually became familiar with the letters, although the reaction was still not fast enough. I hope that the teacher can use Chinese blackboard writing and speak slowly when explaining, otherwise sometimes it is too late to respond to what the teacher is talking about. There are also some inconveniences at a distance.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0770,建議老師在給期末分數時，除了期末考分數外，還能把報告分數給同學，這樣同學比較知道自己的弱項，分數也較透明,"It is suggested that when giving the final grades, the teacher can report the grades to the students in addition to the grades of the final exam, so that the students can better understand their weaknesses and the grades will be more transparent",217,160,0,1,0.0009396672248840332
630cf1bc40e337e60fce077b,謝謝老師的教導！原本很害怕時間數列這堂課很難（的確很難），但老師教學很認真也很相當清楚，只要認真上課大致上就跟得上，且老師在上課時通常會一直重複重要的知識點，讓我們可以更加熟悉、記得，在期末報告也有機會將上課所學實作出來。,"Thank you teacher for teaching! At first, I was afraid that the class of time sequence would be difficult (it is indeed difficult), but the teacher is very serious and very clear in teaching. As long as you take the class seriously, you can generally follow it, and the teacher usually repeats important knowledge points during the class. Let us be more familiar with and remember, and have the opportunity to practice what we have learned in class in the final report.",837,154,0,2,0.999424934387207

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0858,這堂課能學到非常多計量經濟的知識，但是課程難度也提升了，需要花更多時間來複習。考試內容不會到很難，但是成績也是看個人造化。,"This class can learn a lot of econometric knowledge, but the difficulty of the course has also increased, and it takes more time to review. The content of the exam will not be too difficult, but the grades also depend on personal preference.",843,191,0,3,0.02000284194946289
630cf1bc40e337e60fce08c3,除了愚人節那天叫我們抄一堆東西不太懂外，很喜歡這門課!上課輕鬆，考試範圍難度合理適中，助教和老師也很為同學著想。,"Except that on April Fool's Day, we were asked to copy a bunch of things that we didn't understand, but I really liked this class!

630cf1bc40e337e60fce08c0,老師上課的內容會結合自身經驗與書本中的內容，可以接收到老師想表達的東西，也逐漸可以理解為什麼老師要常常上街頭抗議，幫人民爭取權利。,"The content of the teacher's class will be combined with his own experience and the content in the book.

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0832,一堂很讚的課，跟很讚的老師，我非常想上到一學年，只有一學期太可惜了，還有很多想跟小麥學的,"A very good class, with a very good teacher, I really want to go to one school year, it's a pity that there is only one semester, there are still many things I want to learn from Mai Mai",210,153,0,3,0.9564697742462158

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0811,我認爲這堂課的安排非常好，只是如果課程内容少一點的話就會更好！因爲這算是一科技術相關的課程，需要大量的練習，所以少一點内容的話就可以有時間慢慢練習，不用擔心要趕進度而得過且過（學生本身）。此外在上課的時候也會腦袋緊綳，很怕自己會跟不上進度，所以稍稍有些壓力~但在課程中老師會播放好聽的歌曲，喜歡kpop或英文歌的歡迎來這堂課哈哈哈~但我很喜歡這堂課！老師幽默，氛圍輕鬆，内容也很有幫助，所以是很贊的一堂課！,"I thought the class was very well organized, it just would have been better if there was less content! Because this is a technology-related course that requires a lot of practice, so if there is less content, you can have time to practice slowly, and you don’t have to worry about catching up with the progress and muddling along (the students themselves). In addition, my head is tight during class, and I am afraid that I will not be able to keep up with the progress, so I am a little stressed~ But the teacher will play nice songs during the class, if you like kpop or English songs, welcome to this class hahaha~ But I love this class! The teacher is humorous, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the content is very helpful, so it was a great class!",210,153,0,3,0.9963651895523071
630cf1bc40e337e60fce089d,無，老師上課活潑,"No, the teacher is lively in class",2,174,3,1,0.9966351389884949

630cf1bc40e337e60fce08b8,老師人很好，且真的充滿熱情，多年來持續努力，喜歡老師不是只在學院裡高談闊論，而是以實際行動去捍衛人權與土地，老師非常棒，請繼續加油，也是我們的典範。,"The teacher is very kind and full of enthusiasm. He has been working hard for many years. I like the teacher not just talking in the college, but defending human rights and land with practical actions. The teacher is very good, please continue to work hard, and he is also our role model.",840,692,0,1,0.9998321533203125
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0859,老師教的真的很好 不過希望上課可以有更多實例,"The teacher taught really well, but I hope there will be more examples in class",843,191,0,3,0.9939616322517395
630cf1bc40e337e60fce08a1,老師人很好，會鼓勵我們自己思考，課程中也會帶討論，但是上課有一點點快,"The teacher is very nice, he will encourage us to think for ourselves, and there will be discussions in the course, but the class is a little fast",2,174,3,1,0.9989012479782104
630cf1bc40e337e60fce082f,這堂課非常推薦，雖然作業量有點多但受惠良多。,"This class is highly recommended. Although the workload is a bit heavy, it has benefited a lot.",210,153,0,3,0.9996790885925293
630cf1bc40e337e60fce08a9,好喜歡上金龍的課！每週交的心得報告，我覺得更能幫助我們學習課堂上的知識，因為是我們主動去吸收資訊，而非被動的從課堂上接收,"I really like Jinlong's class! The weekly experience report, I think it can help us learn more about the knowledge in the classroom, because we actively absorb information instead of passively receiving it from the classroom",839,170,0,3,0.9988719820976257

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0924,老師人很好，但考試要背的東西很多，下學期名詞解釋因為是填空，看完有個印象就可以了。,"The teacher is very kind, but there are a lot of things to memorize in the exam. The explanation of terms in the next semester is to fill in the blanks, so it is enough to get an impression after reading it.",212,178,0,2,0.07643216848373413

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0989,或許是因為班上有教育系同學，老師講課的時候有時會預設我們懂某些理論的背景或來源，但其實我們英文系學生蠻需要老師講解 此理論的內容、背景、應用、以及最重要的舉例，讓我們能有效且快速的吸收，不須再自己翻課本,"Perhaps it is because there are students from the Department of Education in the class. When the teacher lectures, he sometimes presupposes that we understand the background or source of certain theories, but in fact, we English students really need the teacher to explain the content, background, application, and the most Important examples, so that we can absorb effectively and quickly, without having to turn over the textbooks by ourselves",848,183,3,3,0.985831618309021

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09e1,本課程較多著墨在科技教育。專案較適合小組進行，可惜因為上課人數不多及疫情只能各自獨立工作,"This course focuses more on technology education.

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09e0,期末要做實體的物品真的有點難，因為前面的基礎教學感覺深度還沒那麼深⋯ 另外很邀請Ted老師來教我們焊電路板等等的實作真的很有趣,"It is really difficult to make physical objects at the end of the term, because the previous basic teaching feels that the depth is not that deep... In addition, it is really interesting to invite Mr. Ted to teach us soldering circuit boards and so on.",852,195,0,3,0.15615427494049072
630cf1bd40e337e60fce09d3,老師用心於課程內容，但對於啟發學生對於課程興趣與否似乎不很在意，用自己的想法評價學生，有時難免會讓人很灰心喪志 對於課程出席有要求，但若不合教師自己規定，就算依學校的指引辦理也是不行。讓人無所適從,"The teacher pays attention to the content of the course, but he doesn't seem to care much about inspiring students' interest in the course. Using his own ideas to evaluate students can sometimes make people very discouraged. There are requirements for course attendance, but if it does not meet the teacher's own regulations, even if It is not acceptable to follow the school's guidelines. make people feel at a loss",262,199,0,1,0.0010927915573120117
630cf1bd40e337e60fce09da,首先，期末突然出現一份書面報告且並未事先通知。再來則是授課時數並未足夠，且補課也沒有不足該時數。最後則是期末考30分鐘寫50題，分明是要刁難。,"First, a written report suddenly appeared at the end of the period without prior notice. What's more, the number of teaching hours is not enough, and the number of make-up classes is not insufficient. In the end, I wrote 50 questions in 30 minutes for the final exam, which was obviously to make things difficult.",853,697,0,1,0.029164493083953857
630cf1bd40e337e60fce09f5,老師很有活力，很努力想讓課程變得活潑，也的確讓我每堂課都很清醒。以每週的小作業取代期中期末也很棒，學期末時也超前部署改成遠距上課，謝謝老師,"The teacher was very energetic and worked hard to make the lessons lively and really kept me awake in every class.

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09d5,期末考30分鐘，50題選擇題，其中包含計算題，完全來不及計算，題幹太長的也沒有時間完成，希望老師對於期末考的安排能再更多加思慮些。除了考試，其他部分老師人真的很好很用心。,"The final exam is 30 minutes long, with 50 multiple-choice questions, including calculation questions. There is no time to calculate, and the questions are too long and there is no time to complete them. I hope the teacher can think more about the arrangement of the final exam.

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0b12,老師在上課前的說明，有時候提到個人私事的時候會希望請老師節省時間，把時間投注在有氧完的拉伸吧！不是所有人都願意投注心力聽您的生活。,"The teacher's explanation before class, sometimes when it comes to personal matters, I hope to ask the teacher to save time and spend time on stretching after aerobic exercise!

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09e9,增加課程深度，匆匆帶過其實學不到什麼。叫學生用手機查回答問題，效能不高。,"Increase the depth of the course, and you will not learn much if you take it in a hurry. It is not efficient to ask students to use their mobile phones to check and answer questions.",854,699,0,1,0.0006018877029418945

630cf1bc40e337e60fce098d,這堂課由四個老師輪流上課，坦白說我覺得這樣的學習方式不是很完整，無論是學習社會科學或傳播學的學說都很像是碎片式的，另一堂傳播與當代思潮也有同樣的問題，學習體驗不是很好,"This class is taught by four teachers in turn. Frankly speaking, I think this way of learning is not very complete. Whether it is learning social science or communication, it is very fragmented. The other class of communication and contemporary thought also has the same problem. , the learning experience is not very good",779,695,0,1,0.0003037452697753906
630cf1bd40e337e60fce09ad,老師教課非常有趣，也許能夠讓外籍生容易瞭解通過他的講解專業，刮刮樂課上活動超贊，TA課的話其實也算好，只是太早要來教室所以我應該推薦老師改TA時間會比較好。,"The teacher’s teaching is very interesting, and it may be easy for foreign students to understand the major through his explanations.

The TA class is actually good, but it’s too early to come to the classroom, so I should recommend the teacher to change the TA time. it is good.",21,197,0,1,0.9996422529220581

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09e7,我覺得老師在上課有時指定同學回答問題的作法能夠讓平常較無主動發言意願的同學有表達意見之機會，這種做法我覺得比其他課程只是鼓勵同學發言的方式好,I think the way the teacher sometimes assigns students to answer questions in class can give students who are less willing to speak up the opportunity to express their opinions. I think this method is better than other courses that only encourage students to speak,854,699,0,1,0.604729175567627
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0af5,老師蠻認真上課的但不苟言笑，希望能跟學生多點互動；課程教ps覺得交太淺，連遮色片都沒交太扯；word可以學到東西但相較其他軟體而言平淡無聊，希望能學期他比較有趣的軟體，像是indesign教大家簡單排版之類的；ai2相較而言比較有趣，但ai2設計介面感覺很落時老舊； 期中考的題目太多，一些考題考一些無實質意義的東西，題目中有些修圖方法認識一下可以，但在設計實務上根本用不到，尤其是那個粗糙的去被手法，希望可以交的細緻一點和考實質上用的到的操作內容。,"The teacher is very serious in the class but not smiling, hoping to interact more with the students; the course teaches PS that the teaching is too shallow, and even the masking film is not handed in too much; Word can learn things, but it is dull and boring compared to other software, I hope Can semester he is more interesting software, such as indesign teaching you simple typesetting and so on; ai2 is more interesting in comparison, but the design interface of ai2 feels very outdated and old; there are too many questions in the midterm exam, some exam questions are not As for the substantive things, some image editing methods in the topic can be known, but they are not used in design practice, especially the rough method of de-quitting.

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09f3,老師上課方式輕鬆有趣～ 小組報告分配到的英文文獻好難QQ 不過完成整份報告滿有成就感的！,"The teacher's way of teaching is relaxed and interesting~ The English literature assigned to the group report is very difficult QQ, but the completion of the whole report is full of sense of accomplishment!",590,698,0,1,0.9997619986534119
630cf1bd40e337e60fce09f7,前半學期有同學討論後上台報告的部分，建議老師在每組同學報告後更正他們報告的內容，因為是同學討論出來的結果，並不是正確答案，在一知半解的情況下容易討論出不是很正確的結果，如果就這樣帶過的話會讓其他人接收到錯誤的知識，也很容易讓其他同學覺得報告出來的就是對的。,"In the first half of the semester, there were some students discussing and reporting on the stage. It is recommended that the teacher correct the content of their reports after each group of students reported, because it is the result of the students’ discussion, and it is not the correct answer. It is easy to discuss things that are not very correct under the condition of half-knowledge. As a result, if you pass it like this, others will receive wrong knowledge, and it is easy for other students to think that what is reported is correct.",590,698,0,1,0.002249777317047119
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0b3d,老師很尊重學生，也知道每個學生能力不同，不會要求所有人都要達到一樣的程度，大大減輕我對於上體育課時害怕跟不上的擔憂。此外，老師也很關心學生，無論是生理或心理層面。,"The teacher respects the students very much, and knows that each student has different abilities, and will not require everyone to reach the same level, which greatly alleviates my worries about not being able to keep up in physical education class. In addition, teachers also care about students, whether it is physical or psychological level.",287,217,0,1,0.9969096779823303

It will be more convenient~ I feel that homework (exercise videos or reports) needs to be handed in every week, and personal final exam dances need to be practiced (without a suitable environment, group practice The feeling of becoming an individual practice is still not good), the burden is a little bigger",290,217,0,1,0.0003864169120788574

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09fa,這堂課每周都會有課堂作業（上課完成）並前半由老師授課，後半為同學報告。我覺得老師在跟同學的互動上很不錯，會適時地和我們對話，使上課變有趣；不過，上課的小組討論時常要臨時上台分享，因為還不太懂內容，常會為了思考等等怎麼報告，而無法專心上課，覺得這個部分可以微調形式～但還是謝謝老師的用心安排教學，辛苦了。,"This class will have classroom assignments (completed in class) every week, and the first half will be taught by the teacher, and the second half will be reported to the students. I think the teacher is very good at interacting with the students, he will talk to us in a timely manner, making the class more interesting; however, the group discussion in the class often has to be temporarily shared on stage, because I don’t understand the content very well, and I often report for thinking and so on , and can't concentrate on class, I think this part can be fine-tuned~ But thank you teacher for arranging the teaching carefully, it's hard work.",590,698,0,1,0.9898492097854614

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09f6,老師上課很有趣～課堂作業也都會給提示，不會太難～整體的loading也不會太重！很喜歡老師的課！可惜最後遠距無法上到實體課，覺得有點可惜～,"The teacher's class is very interesting ~ the classwork will also give hints, it will not be too difficult ~ the overall loading will not be too heavy!

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09d2,老師十分用心備課，上課時也非常有耐心教導同學，跟不上的地方也會特別提醒同學要怎麼跳得更好，以及老師非常注重準時上課及準時下課!,"The teacher prepares the lessons very carefully, and is very patient in teaching the students during the class.

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a07,我覺得這堂課整體都很棒！學到很多東西，不過學期快結束時一次三個線上作業+遠距期末報告，有點負荷不來！希望下次可以早一點出作業~~,"I thought the class was great overall!

630cf1bc40e337e60fce0995,分成四個部分個別探討傳播與社會不同的相關議題我覺得非常好，每個老師在自己的專業領域發揮，每一堂課都是滿滿的知識，我覺得整個學期下來收穫良多，老師們都言之有物，讓我能夠用更多不同的面向去看待社會。,"I think it is very good to divide it into four parts to individually discuss the different issues related to communication and society. Each teacher plays in his own professional field, and each class is full of knowledge. I feel that the whole semester has gained a lot. With something to say, it allows me to look at society with more different aspects.",779,695,0,1,0.9990137815475464
630cf1bd40e337e60fce09d0,老師人很好，然後跟大家一起跳土風舞也蠻開心的～ 只是老師很注重出缺席，早八起不來的話可能就先不要,"The teacher is very nice, and I am very happy to dance the folk dance with everyone~ It’s just that the teacher pays attention to absences. If you can’t get up early, maybe you don’t want to",262,199,0,1,0.9989849925041199
630cf1bd40e337e60fce09e6,老師為上課內容的規劃花費很多心力，實作課程非常有趣，老師上課辛苦了！,"The teacher put a lot of effort in planning the content of the class, the practical course is very interesting, the teacher worked hard in class!",854,699,0,1,0.9926319122314453

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09ea,老師的授課風格很獨特，也盡力搭配多元的資源讓學生運用、學習。,"The teacher's teaching style is very unique, and he also tries his best to match a variety of resources for students to use and learn.",854,699,0,1,0.9993510842323303

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09eb,感覺老師非常專業，相關經歷也很豐富。但是建議可以調整作業的內容，減少寫心得的次數，因為不斷的寫心得沒有辦法讓學生運用在課程中所學到的知識。,"I feel that the teacher is very professional and has a lot of relevant experience. However, it is suggested that the content of the homework can be adjusted to reduce the frequency of writing experience, because there is no way for students to apply the knowledge learned in the course by constantly writing experience.",854,699,0,1,0.01304095983505249
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a04,實體課的時候還是希望老師能用板書上課的方式代替在平板上書寫。 課本希望能統一用一本，了解老師覺得不同本課本各有優點，但是常常老師上的內容找不到在哪本課本的何處（已用關鍵字在電子書搜尋仍找不到），或許有些本末倒置。 希望老師能事先規劃好線上作業的繳交時間，而不是接近期末的時候才想起來然後趕緊出作業。 老師人很好很關心學生。,"In the physical class, I still hope that the teacher can use blackboard writing instead of writing on the tablet. I hope that one textbook can be used uniformly. I understand that the teacher feels that different textbooks have their own advantages, but often the content taught by the teacher can’t be found anywhere in the textbook (you can’t find it in the e-book search with keywords), maybe Some put the cart before the horse. I hope the teacher can plan the time for online homework submission in advance, instead of just remembering it when it is near the end of the term and rushing out the homework. The teachers are nice and care about the students.",274,195,0,1,0.04211360216140747
630cf1bc40e337e60fce0994,老師教學認真，我確實學到許多,"The teacher is serious in teaching, I really learned a lot",779,695,0,1,0.9989551305770874

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09d9,很喜歡老師教的課，對於課本的基本內容融合了許多補充的知識，讓整體的教學變得更加的豐富，加上老師本身的幽默風趣，使我對財產保險有了更多的興趣，也更加了解了這方面的知識，不過期末考50題選擇只有半小時可以作答真的有點趕，到最後還有幾題只能空白，有點難過，希望至少有四五十分鐘可以寫，但整體而言我真的很喜歡這堂課，謝謝老師這學期的教導。,"I like the class taught by the teacher very much. I have incorporated a lot of supplementary knowledge into the basic content of the textbook, which makes the overall teaching more enriched. In addition, the teacher's own humor makes me more interested in property insurance, and also I have a better understanding of this aspect of knowledge, but it is really a bit rushed to answer the 50 questions in the final exam for only half an hour. At the end, there are still a few questions that can only be blank, which is a bit sad. I hope that I can write at least forty or fifty minutes, but overall I really like this class, thank you teacher for teaching me this semester.",853,697,0,1,0.20187509059906006
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a08,老師很厲害，但程式部分有點自己講自己的，不太好懂，平常不出做業，期末考期間為了可以評分直接三份作業加期末報告一起來，學生負擔過大。,"The teacher is very good, but the programming part is a bit self-proclaimed, which is not easy to understand. Usually, there is no homework. During the final exam, the three homeworks and the final report are directly included in order to be able to grade. The burden on the students is too heavy.",274,195,0,1,0.0007783174514770508
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0aeb,期中考時間太短，會寫卻來不及寫完，導致分數偏低，失去對此科目的信心。,"The time for the midterm exam is too short, and I can write it but it is too late to finish it, resulting in a low score and losing confidence in this subject.",210,212,0,3,0.00019437074661254883

630cf1bd40e337e60fce09ec,老師上課的內容超乎我的想像（褒義），除了有校外教學甚至還有程式學習。 這些東西對我來說獲益良多，也開啟了對於數位外交和科技的興趣。 老師上課請來的外部講師與課程外內容也都非常專業且容易入門，整體課程不會讓人覺得無法負擔。,"The content of the teacher's class is beyond my imagination (praise), in addition to off-campus teaching and even programming learning. These things have benefited me a lot and started my interest in digital diplomacy and technology. The external lecturers invited by the teacher and the content outside the course are also very professional and easy to get started.

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0ac2,希望可以注意時間，常常拖到快20分鐘的下課時間：（,"I hope you can pay attention to the time, and it is often delayed until the end of class time is almost 20 minutes: (",857,211,0,3,0.005596935749053955
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0b39,老師人很好～會主動關心學生，常常會問課程內容有沒有需要調整的或是下課之後會和還沒離開的同學聊天。課堂上的氛圍讓我運動的時候可以放很開，運動完後都有伸展，遠距之後都沒辦法動真的很可惜！,"The teachers are very nice~ they will take the initiative to care about the students, and often ask if there is any need to adjust the course content or chat with the students who have not left after class. The atmosphere in the classroom allows me to relax when exercising, and I stretch after exercising. It’s a pity that I can’t move after a long distance!",287,217,0,1,0.9196150302886963
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0b62,跑大學報的專題可以學到很多採訪寫作外的技巧，雖然累但充實也好玩，很值得,"You can learn a lot of skills other than interviewing and writing by running the special topics of university newspapers. Although it is tiring, it is fulfilling and fun. It is worth it",858,221,0,1,0.9998816251754761

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0af3,我認為此課程期中前教的word跟photoshop雖然淺但仍算實用，但期中後教授的AI2 app程式設計我認為在實際運用上根本不會去用這個工具，做出來的效果也很差，學習這個工具幾乎沒有意義，希望以後能夠教授實際上運用的上的工具。,"I think the word and photoshop taught before the mid-term of this course are shallow but still practical, but the AI2 app programming taught after the mid-term I don’t think I will use this tool at all in actual application, and the effect is also very poor. This tool is almost meaningless, and I hope to be able to teach practical tools in the future.",210,212,0,3,0.0002486109733581543
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0b63,我了解老師來帶這門課非常辛苦，且平時不吝嗇地給了我們好多建議，無論是對未來或是現在的選擇。不過還是希望能透過這堂課學習到更多新聞業的倫理以及法規、抑或更掌握現今台灣的報導模式、方向和例子等等，因為我們學習到較多國外（如new york times、BBC等）大媒體的報導，不過較沒有學習到接近我們現在正在實踐的方向。總歸而言，非常謝謝老師的帶領和豐富的建議，好喜歡老師和晨晨！！,"I understand that it is very hard for the teacher to lead this class, and he usually gives us a lot of advice, whether it is for the future or the current choice. However, I still hope that through this class, I can learn more about the ethics and laws of the journalism industry, or have a better grasp of the current reporting model, direction and examples in Taiwan, etc., because we have learned a lot from foreign countries (such as new york times, BBC, etc.) ) big media reports, but they have not learned the direction that is close to what we are practicing now. All in all, thank you very much for the teacher's leadership and rich suggestions. I really like the teacher and Chenchen! !",858,221,0,1,0.9974871873855591

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0aef,老師教的蠻認真，也很容易瞭解，只是名額恐缺，難選上課程。希望老師能夠開多幾門課。,"The teacher teaches very seriously and is easy to understand, but there may be a shortage of places, so it is difficult to choose courses. I hope the teacher can teach more classes.",210,212,0,3,0.0038388967514038086
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0acc,關於上課內容皆照念簡報，惟簡報內容皆係自書本之剪貼，過於繁雜，令人難以知悉很處為重點。建議老師更改上課模式，精簡上課內容，深入為佳，廣度則提供管道供學生自行參閱即可，一方面在準備考試上比較有著力點，也不耗磨對本課程之熱忱。,"The content of the class is read from the briefing, but the contents of the briefing are all cut and paste from the book, which is too complicated, making it difficult to know the key point. It is recommended that the teacher change the class mode, simplify the class content, and the in-depth is better, and the breadth provides channels for students to refer to themselves. On the one hand, it is more focused on preparing for the exam, and it does not waste the enthusiasm for this course.",859,208,0,1,0.9724186062812805

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0b3f,老師很有包容心，尊重學生的意見和難處，也會提醒大家怎樣運動才不會受傷，很關心同學～是門沒什麼負擔的體育課唷！每次上完課都沒有流汗，只有手腳暖暖的，很喜歡這門課，謝謝老師,"The teacher is very tolerant and respects the opinions and difficulties of the students.

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0adb,資料分析作業略為艱澀，建議提供參考資料或影片 / 希望下課時間可以準時 / 希望期末考可以手下留情，因為遠距考試規則好多，擔心題目太多或太難會來不及完成上傳，而期末範圍又較大，準備上較期中困難許多。,"The data analysis assignment is a bit difficult, and it is recommended to provide reference materials or videos / I hope that the end of class can be on time / I hope that the final exam can be merciful, because there are many rules in the distance exam, I am worried that too many or too difficult questions will be too late to complete the upload, and the final scope is relatively large It is much more difficult to prepare than mid-term.",841,211,0,1,0.004273176193237305

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0b61,這學期跑專題很快樂，很喜歡我的組員！雖然我們是人數最少的組，但我們做了好多好多，也做得很好～大學報的大家辛苦了,"I am very happy to run a special topic this semester, and I like my team members very much!

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0af0,能感受老師授課十分用心，不過若期中的PS平時較少接觸，要在時間內全部做完較為困難,"I can feel that the teacher is very attentive in teaching, but if you don’t have much contact with PS in the midterm, it will be difficult to finish all within the time",210,212,0,3,0.005908191204071045

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0aee,作業負擔不大，讓學生大部分可以在課程時間內完成作業，真的很棒!老師也很快速地因應疫情調整上課方式，讓我們自由選擇是否到教室上課，減少學生的風險。謝謝老師!,"The homework burden is not heavy, and most of the students can complete the homework within the course time, which is really great! The teacher also quickly adjusted the class method in response to the epidemic situation, allowing us to freely choose whether to go to the classroom to reduce the risk of students.

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0aca,老師教學認真，上課內容豐富，收穫良多，希望可以多增加不動產部分的內容比例,"The teacher is serious in teaching, the content of the class is rich, and I have gained a lot. I hope to increase the content ratio of the real estate part",859,208,0,1,0.9997647404670715

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a61,謝謝老師上課都會先說明接下來的內容會想要解決什麼問題，然後再說明大綱，最後才一項一項細細說，這樣的方法真的讓我們很容易學習，尤其是老師每每把前面的東西拿來使用時都會把整個式子複製一遍，這個更是可以讓我們在還不熟的時候能夠參照。希望以後還會上到您的課！,"Thank you teacher. In class, you will first explain what problems the next content will solve, then explain the outline, and finally explain each item in detail. This method really makes it easy for us to learn, especially when the teacher often uses the previous content. When things are used, the entire formula will be copied again. This is even more useful for us to refer to when we are not familiar with it. Hope to take your class again in the future!",197,193,0,1,0.9939644932746887
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0adc,課程中有同步以及非同步的課程安排，我認為這樣安排很好，因為非同步課程多為計算，可以讓我重複觀看來弄熟不清楚的觀念！老師上課也非常認真講解課程，也會鼓勵學生回答問題,"There are synchronous and asynchronous course arrangements in the course. I think this arrangement is very good, because the asynchronous courses are mostly calculations, which allows me to watch repeatedly to get familiar with unclear concepts! The teacher also explains the course very seriously in class and encourages students to answer questions",841,211,0,1,0.9988541603088379

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0ac9,希望老師講課不單單是照著簡報念，而且簡報的文字很多，考試範圍也很廣，很難負荷得了,"I hope that the teacher will not only read the lectures according to the briefing, but also the briefing has a lot of text, and the scope of the test is also very wide, so it is difficult to load",859,208,0,1,0.15498512983322144

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0ac4,期中期末要準備的東西有點太多，尤其是要全部背起來有點吃力。建議老師可以改變題型，不全然是只測驗學生們背誦的能力，著重在其他比如如何應用課堂知識或思考能力...　也謝謝老師這學期辛勤的教學！,"There are too many things to prepare at the end of the mid-term, especially it is a bit difficult to memorize them all. It is suggested that the teacher can change the question type, not just to test the students' recitation ability, but to focus on other things such as how to apply classroom knowledge or thinking ability...

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a94,建議不要塞那麼多課後作業，我認為在短時間要練很多舞的作業量，對於沒練舞經驗的人很吃虧，感覺一定要有練舞經驗才有機會取得高分，建議自學的艾文艾利不應列為作業。,It is recommended not to cram so much after-school homework. I think it takes a lot of homework to practice in a short period of time. It is a disadvantage for those who have no experience in dancing. I feel that you must have experience in dancing to have a chance to get a high score. I suggest self-taught Ai Wen Ailey should not be listed as a homework.,261,199,0,1,0.0016375184059143066

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a87,老師的教學節奏對無基礎者非常友善，也主張無壓力學習，是堂不會感到壓力也可以有大量收穫的課,"The teacher's teaching rhythm is very friendly to those who have no foundation, and also advocates stress-free learning. It is a class that does not feel pressure and can gain a lot",860,202,0,3,0.9936347007751465
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a8b,真的是很涼的課，老師不在意出席，只要寫3000字報告就好，還蠻慶幸自己有選到這堂課,"It's really a cool class, the teacher doesn't care about attendance, just write a 3000-word report, I'm glad I chose this class",861,701,0,3,0.9971410036087036

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a5e,謝謝老師的教導。我覺得老師可以提供一些不錯的選文給我們選擇報告，這樣題材也可以比較多元，例如，生活、文學、文化、科普、政治等多個面向的文章。,"Thank you teacher for teaching.

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a54,希望在實習助教課部分可以多在老師上課讀地方做補充少一些延伸 因為很多延伸的部分在正課沒有上到 突然在助教課提出會有種難以銜接的感覺,"I hope that in the teaching assistant class part of the internship, I can make more supplements in the reading place of the teacher in class and less extension, because many extended parts are not covered in the main class, and it will feel difficult to connect when I suddenly raise it in the teaching assistant class.",255,194,0,1,0.0007570981979370117
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a98,老師以不同的元素來教導現代舞，時常會有分組表演的機會，讓我受益良多。,"The teacher teaches modern dance with different elements, and there are often opportunities to perform in groups, which benefits me a lot.",261,199,0,1,0.9998708963394165

630cf1bc40e337e60fce097a,我覺得老師真的很棒 特別是在課程上錄影這塊 能讓學生有很好的機會再次複習 同時老師講解觀念也非常清楚 用比較基礎的方式表達 讓同學們能更好的理解課程內容,"I think the teacher is really great, especially the video recording in the course, which can give students a good opportunity to review again. At the same time, the teacher explains the concept very clearly and expresses it in a relatively basic way, so that students can better understand the course content",110,178,0,2,0.9996325969696045

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a8a,老師的見解會讓我深思很多，不過上課時有時內容會重複提及，會讓我混亂抓不到重點～,"The teacher's opinion will make me think a lot, but sometimes the content will be mentioned repeatedly in class, which will make me confused and miss the point~",861,701,0,3,0.0003707408905029297

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a18,老師上課口條流暢，內容清晰明確，但上課節奏和速度有點過快，還有考試範圍有點多。,"The teacher speaks fluently in class, and the content is clear and clear, but the rhythm and speed of the class are a bit too fast, and the scope of the exam is a bit too much.",777,186,0,2,0.0004943609237670898

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0aa2,老師講課比較多都是簡略念過PPT的內容，所以基本上還是要自己回去重讀課本才能理解,"Most of the teacher's lectures are briefly read the content of the PPT, so basically you have to go back and reread the textbook to understand",99,205,0,1,0.003391265869140625
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a1e,老師講得很清楚，雖然有時候版書比較難看清楚，但整體而言還是推推！,"The teacher made it very clear, although sometimes the version is difficult to read clearly, but on the whole it is still recommended!",777,186,0,2,0.9998155236244202

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a53,我覺得助教實體教學的時候稍顯沒有自信，不論是音量還是板書都可以再更清楚一點，也希望能夠更針對老師的上課內容去做複習以及給予同學練習時間，因為有時候會出現額外補充的內容太過進階，完全沒有辦法吸收的狀況發生，感覺助教沒有完全掌握老師上課教的進度。,"I feel that the teaching assistant is a little unconfident when teaching in person. Whether it is the volume or writing on the blackboard, I can be more clear. I also hope that I can review the content of the teacher's class and give students time to practice, because sometimes there will be additional supplements. The content is too advanced and there is no way to absorb it at all. I feel that the teaching assistant has not fully grasped the progress of the teacher's teaching in class.",255,194,0,1,0.0002848505973815918
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a85,謝謝老師用心地授課，耐心地講解一些很基礎的語法等知識，也讓我們可以更了解阿美族的文化。很喜歡老師的課，謝謝！,"Thank you teacher for teaching carefully and patiently explaining some very basic grammar and other knowledge, which also allows us to better understand the culture of the Amis.

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a3e,希望講解程式的時候速度可以放慢，或者事先給我們當天要上課的程式，避免上課時手忙腳亂,"I hope that the speed can be slowed down when explaining the program, or give us the program to be taught that day in advance, so as to avoid being in a hurry during class",274,195,0,1,0.0017068982124328613
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a3d,希望老師可以給我們多一點時間寫作業，臨時加的期末報告可以講更具體一點，然後給多一點時間寫。,"I hope the teacher can give us more time to do homework, and the temporary final report can be more specific, and then give us more time to write.",274,195,0,1,0.0017820000648498535
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0aa1,我覺得老師講課的時候的那些簡稱可以用中文講，不然有時候課程節奏太快還沒記得聽的時候就會聽不太懂,"I think the abbreviations used by the teacher during lectures can be spoken in Chinese, otherwise sometimes the pace of the course is too fast and you don’t remember to listen to it, you will not understand well",99,205,0,1,0.000877082347869873
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a64,老師，遠距後使用預錄的方法讓我們可以一直把不太懂的地方重看，實在很棒，當然也是因為後面課程偏南,"Teacher, using the pre-recording method after a long distance allows us to rewatch the places we don't understand all the time.",197,193,0,1,0.012290596961975098
630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a8f,這堂課主要著重在即興創作的部分，現代舞的練習反而比較少，覺得這點蠻可惜的，但即興創作的部分確實也給予我們很多腦力激盪的空間與練習。另外，聽說老師這學期準備要退休了，覺得很可惜，學弟妹們少了一堂教材與指導者都能與時俱進且有明確學習路徑與架構的好課TT,"This class mainly focuses on the part of improvisation, and there are relatively few exercises in modern dance. I think this is a pity, but the part of improvisation does give us a lot of room for brainstorming and practice. In addition, I heard that the teacher is going to retire this semester, and I feel that it is a pity that the younger students are missing a good class with teaching materials and instructors that can keep pace with the times and have a clear learning path and structure TT",261,199,0,1,0.0006082057952880859

I still like the physical way of teaching, but I didn't expect that it would be the last time I saw Jose, and I was heartbroken!",862,222,0,3,0.986523449420929

630cf1be40e337e60fce0bf2,老師人真的很好，上課總是很親切問大家有沒有聽懂，也很願意再講清楚、講更仔細。而且上課的簡報講義也整理的很清楚，很有邏輯架構，該有的案例等等也都會放上，讓人很好理解！真的很喜歡老師～辛苦了！,"The teacher is really nice. He always kindly asks everyone if they understand in class, and is willing to explain clearly and more carefully. Moreover, the lecture notes of the class are also organized very clearly, with a logical structure, and the necessary cases and so on are also included, which makes it easy to understand! I really like the teacher~ Thank you for your hard work!",868,702,0,3,0.9998098015785217
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c02,雖然上面每一個都勾非常同意看起來很荒謬，但我個人真的在各方面都很喜歡這堂課。內容、同儕和教學方式都是！很感謝可以修到老師開的法文課！希望之後不要撞到必修可以繼續上...,"While every one of the above ticked strongly agrees that it looks ridiculous, I personally really enjoyed this class in every way. The content, the peers, and the teaching style are all! I am very grateful that I can take the French class taught by the teacher! I hope that I will not hit the compulsory course in the future and can continue to study...",869,232,10,3,0.9997331500053406
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c46,老師對於課程進度的掌握良好，講解理論也很好理解。 但是希望老師在講解自己經手過的個案時可以稍微客觀一點，在講完自己的作為後要求我們鼓掌，會讓人覺得有點怪怪的。還有關於期中報告只在十組裡抽四組報告的話，有的組別有上台的機會，有的沒有，對於報告呈現的完整度不太公平。,"The teacher has a good grasp of the progress of the course, and the theory is well understood. But I hope that the teacher can be a little more objective when explaining the cases he has handled. It will make people feel a little weird to ask us to applaud after explaining what he has done. Also, if only four out of ten groups are selected for the mid-term report, some groups have the opportunity to be on stage, and some do not, which is not fair to the completeness of the report presentation.",9,229,0,1,0.030239462852478027
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c4c,老師上課很有趣，而且會給大家很多人生道理與故事，以她在業界的角度來對待我們這些大學生，積極鼓勵我們參與課堂討論。 最後，小心課堂雷組員ㄏㄏ,"The teacher's class is very interesting, and she will give you a lot of life principles and stories. She treats us college students from her perspective in the industry, and actively encourages us to participate in class discussions. Finally, be careful of the classroom thunder team members ㄏ ㄏ",9,229,0,1,0.9998478889465332

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a12,很幸運能選上如此搶手的課程，老師上課超有活力不會無聊只是速度很快，教科書輔助就好上課專心考前複習講義能有不錯成效。,"I am very lucky to be able to choose such a popular course. The teacher is very energetic and not boring in class, but the speed is very fast. It is good to use textbooks to assist in class. Concentrating on reviewing the handouts before the exam can achieve good results.",777,186,0,2,0.996907651424408
630cf1be40e337e60fce0b8a,微積分以遠距方式比較有效率，實體上課花很多時間等待老師寫板書。但遠距影片畫質低，看不太清楚,"Calculus is more efficient in a remote way, and the physical class spends a lot of time waiting for the teacher to write on the blackboard. However, the quality of the long-distance video is low, and it is not clear",96,233,0,1,0.00044208765029907227

630cf1be40e337e60fce0b94,希望老師在上課時表達清楚，否則台下的同學不太能瞭解上課內容。然而，線上上課改善了這個問題。建議修習這堂課的同學要多花時間在微積分上。,"I hope the teacher can express clearly during the class, otherwise the students in the audience will not be able to understand the content of the class. However, taking classes online has improved this problem. It is recommended that students who take this course spend more time on calculus.",96,233,0,1,0.6681075096130371
630cf1be40e337e60fce0b96,實體的時候，老師講太快了！所以遠距效果意外很好，因為可以重看很多遍！,"When it comes to reality, the teacher speaks too fast! So the long-distance effect is surprisingly good, because it can be re-watched many times!",96,233,0,1,0.9995777010917664
630cf1be40e337e60fce0b9e,考試太難，且配分不合理，基本題的配分應大於較難的題目，確保有認真算課本習題的同學可以及格,"The exam is too difficult, and the allocation is unreasonable. The allocation of basic questions should be greater than that of more difficult questions, so as to ensure that students who seriously calculate textbook exercises can pass",96,233,0,1,0.00048363208770751953

630cf1be40e337e60fce0be3,希望課前能先講述本堂課或本單元會用到的單字，學生會比較有方向，複習時也較能找到重點。,"I hope that before the class, I can tell the words that will be used in this class or this unit, so that students will have more direction and can find the key points when reviewing.",311,237,6,1,0.270386278629303
630cf1be40e337e60fce0bf0,這門課程讓我對建築法規領域有了基礎以上的認識，很符合我當初修習的初衷，同時感覺的出老師很認真用心的在準備每一堂課，教學的方式與表達也很清晰易懂，有助於我的學習！,"This course gave me a more than basic understanding of the field of building regulations, which was in line with my original intention of taking the course.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0c40,很喜歡老師上課的時候會鼓勵我們多去思考，並且跟我們互動、討論，老師分享的經驗和例子也給我很多啟發，真的是受益良多。建議的部分是我記得當初上課前有說過好像會固定一段時間以小組換座位，但這學期只換過一次而已，可能要再注意一下,"I really like that the teacher encourages us to think more during class, and interacts and discusses with us. The experience and examples shared by the teacher also inspire me a lot, and I really benefit a lot. The part of the suggestion is that I remember that before the class, I said that it seems that the group will change seats for a fixed period of time, but this semester only changed once, so I may have to pay attention to it again.",9,229,0,1,0.9996936321258545
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c21,這門課真的讓我的思考方式有很大的改變，謝謝老師這麼用心，絕對是大學甚至是人生中影響自己最大也最印象深刻的一門課。,This course really changed my way of thinking a lot. Thank you teacher for being so hardworking. It is definitely the most influential and impressive course in college and even in life.,863,231,0,2,0.9998093247413635

630cf1be40e337e60fce0c0a,這堂課感覺偏向文法的學習，所以考試難度頗高。但希望老師能用一些會話、口試來增加考試的多元性。Merci beaucoup!,"This class seems to be biased towards the study of grammar, so the test is quite difficult. But I hope the teacher can use some conversational and oral tests to increase the diversity of the test. Merci beaucoup!",870,232,0,3,0.15539586544036865

630cf1be40e337e60fce0b9f,老師上課很認真，但是一次上課的量很大的，考試難度相對上學期增加蠻多的，助教非常認真，會幫同學勾選題目，也很樂於回答同學的問題，就算遠距還是很認真在上助教課！,"The teacher is very serious in class, but the amount of class is very large, the difficulty of the exam is much higher than that of the previous semester, the teaching assistant is very serious, will help the students to check the questions, and is also very willing to answer the students' questions, even if they are far away, they are very serious. Take a TA class!",96,233,0,1,0.9991600513458252
630cf1be40e337e60fce0bc5,李老師非常親切，上課的內容多與統計學與財務管理相關，不會到非常困難，但的確需要時間消化。,"Teacher Li is very kind. The content of the class is mostly related to statistics and financial management. It is not very difficult, but it does take time to digest.",865,226,0,3,0.8805188536643982
630cf1be40e337e60fce0bea,大推！！！,Big push! ! !,862,222,0,3,0.9968968629837036
630cf1be40e337e60fce0be1,考試題目有一定難度，但老師很用心，教課很詳細也很扎實，這學期辛苦老師了。,"The exam questions are difficult, but the teacher is very attentive, and the lectures are very detailed and solid. I have worked hard for the teacher this semester.",311,237,6,1,0.9998571872711182
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c24,很喜歡老師的課，提供了現在我們這個年齡層（或者應該是所有人）在心理層面需要的養分。,"I really like the teacher's class, which provides the nourishment that our age group (or should be all people) needs at the psychological level.",863,231,0,2,0.9995438456535339

630cf1be40e337e60fce0c20,老師教得很淺顯易懂，是很適合入門者的課，比起教艱澀的理論，更多是教如何利用現象學的視角看待眼前的世界，或是重新經驗曾經的經驗，老師是很有趣的人，非常喜歡老師對於生活的態度，覺得上這門課後在很多方面都有所獲益：）,"The teacher's teaching is very simple and easy to understand, which is very suitable for beginners. Rather than teaching difficult theories, it is more about teaching how to use the perspective of phenomenology to look at the world in front of you, or to re-experience previous experiences. The teacher is very interesting I like the teacher's attitude towards life very much, and I feel that I have benefited in many ways after taking this course :)",863,231,0,2,0.9996598958969116
630cf1be40e337e60fce0d17,老師教學用心！會一步一步教，網球好好玩！,"The teacher teaches hard! Will teach step by step, tennis is fun!",188,240,0,1,0.9997705817222595
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c6d,李老師第一次開課 表現十分精彩 讓我更了解環境法域與空間規劃間的關係,"Mr. Li's performance in the first class was very exciting, which made me better understand the relationship between environmental law and space planning",871,702,0,3,0.9994213581085205
630cf1be40e337e60fce0ba2,遠距後有調整評分比例，但是希望可以注意一下原本有的小考佔比，因為我的數學能力並不好，原本期望可以透過完全可以準備到的小考來拉升成績，無奈因應疫情導致考試比例有調整，希望老師可以注意一下數學能力不佳的同學的負荷能力,"There is an adjustment to the score ratio after the distance, but I hope that I can pay attention to the proportion of the original quiz, because my math ability is not good. The test ratio has been adjusted, I hope the teacher can pay attention to the load capacity of students with poor math ability",96,233,0,1,0.0014189481735229492
630cf1be40e337e60fce0bb4,老師很認真，也很親切!實體授課可以做到增加口說和聽力的練習，而遠距非同步則能幫助學習較慢的同學容易理解課程內容，各有各的好處!,"The teacher is very serious and kind! Physical teaching can increase the practice of speaking and listening, while distance asynchronous can help students who learn slowly to understand the content of the course, each has its own advantages!",864,232,0,3,0.9995563626289368
630cf1be40e337e60fce0be8,這學期有文化講座覺得很不錯但遠距教學後真的少了很多對話練習,"I think it's good to have cultural lectures this semester, but I really lost a lot of dialogue practice after distance teaching",862,222,0,3,0.0002993345260620117

630cf1be40e337e60fce0bdf,老師能清楚傳達教學理念和內容，讓學生們都能確實打好土文文法基出！,"The teacher can clearly convey the teaching concept and content, so that the students can really lay a good foundation in local language and grammar!",311,237,6,1,0.9997326731681824
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c1e,老師習慣提出許多例子，但對於初學者來說，先一節一節說明現象學主旨，打好基礎再舉例會比較知道在幹嘛,"The teacher is used to giving many examples, but for beginners, first explain the main idea of phenomenology one by one, lay a solid foundation and then give examples to better understand what you are doing",863,231,0,2,0.8155068755149841
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c38,完美，但後半學期遠距沒辦法把歌教完頗可惜，希望還有機會上到Jose的課,"It's perfect, but it's a pity that I can't finish teaching the song from a distance in the second half of the semester. I hope to have the opportunity to take Jose's class again",862,222,0,3,0.9951872825622559
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c43,老師上課很推，除了會問同學問題與同學互動，還會跟我們分享老師以前的案例，讓我受益良多,"The teacher is very pushy in class. In addition to asking questions and interacting with classmates, he will also share the teacher's previous cases with us, which has benefited me a lot",9,229,0,1,0.9991143345832825
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c50,獲益良多！！！,gain much! ! !,9,229,0,1,0.9996182918548584
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c4d,老師每上完一個部分就會跟我們分享相關經驗，有的時候也會給出個案讓我們動腦想看看，要怎麼運用老師教過的觀念來解決，即使沒辦法馬上給出答案的同學老師也會引導，鼓勵同學盡量提出想法。,"The teacher will share relevant experience with us every time he finishes a part, and sometimes he will give us a case for us to use our brains to think about how to use the concepts taught by the teacher to solve the problem, even if the classmates and teachers who cannot give the answer immediately It will also guide and encourage students to put forward their ideas as much as possible.",9,229,0,1,0.9940723776817322
630cf1be40e337e60fce0b86,我覺得這堂課可以學到很多關於XR和5G實務方面的經驗，在做專案報告的時候也是實際跟著老師那邊正在實際執行的專案去做，老師也會派人協助幫忙各組的專案，但建議老師在一開始說明期末報告時可以描述再細一點，這樣比較好規劃報告該怎麼做，不過可以累積實際參與實務方面的經驗也還不錯。,"I think this class can learn a lot about XR and 5G practical experience. When doing project reports, I actually follow the projects that the teacher is actually implementing. The teacher will also send people to help each group of projects. But it is recommended that the teacher can describe the final report in more detail at the beginning, so that it is better to plan how to do the report, but it is not bad to accumulate practical experience in participating in the practice.",867,225,0,3,0.9870829582214355
630cf1be40e337e60fce0b97,考試真的難... 不過老師跟助教都教得很好 辛苦了！,"The exam is really difficult... But the teacher and teaching assistants are teaching very well, hard work!",96,233,0,1,0.999221682548523

630cf1be40e337e60fce0b95,我覺得不一定要考很困難的題目，這樣未必能強化學生學習的動機,"I don't think it is necessary to take very difficult questions, which may not strengthen students' motivation to learn",96,233,0,1,0.0002525448799133301
630cf1be40e337e60fce0cdf,老師能針對每個人的動作進行調整真的很棒，而且老師很幽默，上課也簡單易懂！真的能體會到桌球的美好與快樂,"It's really great that the teacher can adjust according to everyone's movements, and the teacher is very humorous, and the class is easy to understand!

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a13,超喜歡瑀如老師！幾乎每次上課精神都會很好（大學上課時數較長容易恍神，但老師的課完全不會），很期待可以聽老師講很多案例故事，而且架構組織都很清楚，很容易進入狀況也不太會跟丟，每次都收穫滿滿，很喜歡這堂課～謝謝老師！,"I love Yuru teacher so much! Almost every class is in good spirits (University class hours are long and it is easy to get distracted, but the teacher’s class is not good at all), I am looking forward to listening to the teacher tell a lot of case stories, and the structure organization is very clear, it is easy to enter the situation and also I don’t know how to lose track, and I gain a lot every time.

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a4d,孟庭助教真的很棒也很可愛xdd強烈推薦學弟妹一定要去上考前的助教課，考前筆記真的幫我省了超多時間的！唯一的小缺點是遠距後開放期中考不及格的同學解題就可以加分，感覺對期中考有努力考好的同學有點小不公平QQ,Meng Ting's teaching assistant is really great and cute xdd I strongly recommend that younger students must go to the teaching assistant class before the exam. The pre-exam notes really saved me a lot of time! The only small disadvantage is that students who fail the mid-term exam can get extra points for solving problems after the distance. I feel that it is a bit unfair for students who have worked hard to pass the mid-term exam. QQ,255,194,0,1,0.20089036226272583
630cf1be40e337e60fce0b8e,實體上課的時候黑板的字很容易都看不到，可能需要換教室，或是換新的筆,It is easy to lose sight of the words on the blackboard during the physical class. It may be necessary to change the classroom or use a new pen,96,233,0,1,0.001328587532043457
630cf1be40e337e60fce0b9c,在下不才，上課有點跟不上，錄影片反而聽得懂，比較建議老師用錄影片的方式教學。,"I'm not a student, I can't keep up with the class, but I can understand the video, so I suggest teachers to use the video to teach.",96,233,0,1,0.9762150645256042
630cf1be40e337e60fce0b9b,雖然實體考試的方式就跟以往一樣很公平沒什麼問題，但是遠距考試的方式有點強人所難，助教開的教室上限100人，老師要求每個學生都開雙鏡頭，一下子教室就滿了，導致我晚了10分鐘左右才進到教室考試….根本寫不完。還有掃描再上傳pdf也是弄了超久交不了，而且我在考試前一天就已經先下載全能掃描王了，最後還是超過17秒，直接寄給助教。希望老師下次可以改出作業就好，拜託啦🥲,"Although the physical examination method is as fair as before, there is no problem, but the remote examination method is a bit difficult. The teaching assistant can open a classroom with a maximum of 100 people. The teacher requires every student to use dual cameras, and the classroom is full at once. I entered the classroom about 10 minutes late for the exam... I couldn't finish writing at all. It also took a long time to scan and upload the pdf, and I downloaded Almighty Scanner the day before the exam, and it took more than 17 seconds to send it directly to the teaching assistant.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0c05,雖然是英文授課，但老師重要的點會用中文再說明一次，對我來說很有幫助，謝謝老師，辛苦了。,"Although the class is taught in English, the teacher will explain the important points again in Chinese, which is very helpful to me. Thank you, teacher, for your hard work.",112,220,3,1,0.9997372031211853

630cf1be40e337e60fce0c1c,這堂課真的是會激發我繼續學習法文的動力，非常適合法文初學者，這堂課絕對不會有飆車所以讓學生們都聽不懂的問題，不但課程進度是比較緩慢、舒適的，老師的語調及講述的知識也讓人覺得上課滿開心的，只要搞懂老師上課說的東西，考試也不會有太大壓力。另外，我很喜歡聽老師講法國文化的事情~,"This class will really motivate me to continue learning French. It is very suitable for French beginners. This class will definitely not have a problem of drag racing so that students can’t understand. Not only is the progress of the class relatively slow and comfortable, The tone of the teacher's tone and the knowledge he narrates also make people feel that the class is full of joy.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0b90,上課難度與考試、習題難度相差太大，甚至還要考台大微甲題目，請老師調整考試難易度及調整每次的範圍，老師課綱說每週花9小時以上在本課程，但實際比9小時還多很多，甚至有認真寫題目也不一定會考好。,"The difficulty of the class is too different from the difficulty of the exam and exercises, and even the National Taiwan University Micro-A questions are required. Please ask the teacher to adjust the difficulty of the exam and adjust the scope of each time.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0bb3,老師的課程節奏掌握得很好，可以很快進入狀況，講較難的文法時也不會覺得很痛苦，但有時候會無法跟舊的東西連結起來，小小的希望老師在實體課時也能提供文法的簡報，方便複習所有的重點。整體來說，好課推薦~,"The teacher's lesson rhythm is very good, you can get into the situation quickly, and you don't feel painful when you speak difficult grammar, but sometimes you can't connect with the old things.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0ba1,老師上課的教學方式非常仔細，讓微積分變得好懂，考卷也會有與經濟學相關的應用題,"The teacher's teaching method is very careful, making calculus easy to understand, and the exam papers will also have economics-related application questions",96,233,0,1,0.9946870803833008

630cf1be40e337e60fce0b91,教的太少，而且考試難易度落差太大。經濟系微積分那麼重要應該修微甲吧,"There is too little teaching, and the gap in difficulty of the exam is too large. Calculus in the Department of Economics is so important, you should take Micro-A",96,233,0,1,0.005691707134246826

630cf1bd40e337e60fce0a11,老師上課步調慢，講解詳細，雖然進度不快，但總是能跟得上進度。小小的缺點是老師板書偏小、只寫在左邊，希望老師可以考慮用別種方式寫板書!,"The teacher's class pace is slow and the explanation is detailed. Although the progress is not fast, he can always keep up with the progress. A small disadvantage is that the teacher's writing on the blackboard is too small and only writes on the left side.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0ca3,老師教的很好，也是很認真的老師，分配了很多助教讓我們問問題，上課聽不懂也可以一直看上課的錄影，給分蠻甜的，但考題難度有點大…不過總體來說非常讚！,"The teacher teaches very well and is also a very serious teacher. He has assigned a lot of teaching assistants to let us ask questions. If you don’t understand the class, you can watch the video of the class all the time. The score is pretty sweet, but the exam questions are a bit difficult...but overall very good great!",99,268,0,1,0.9997991919517517
630cf1be40e337e60fce0cb9,本人看起來...怎麼說，看起來就是中年肥宅，或是感覺CWT會場會看到的人(無貶義)，但其實人還滿讚的、也很願意回答問題，課程流程清晰，講解的Flow也很順暢，板書不醜、好懂，分數個人覺得沒到特別甜，但也不會很難拿，有努力80+一定沒問題，總體還滿推的。,"I look... how to put it, I look like a middle-aged fat house, or I feel like I will see people in the CWT venue (no derogatory meaning), but in fact, I am full of praise and willing to answer questions. The course process is clear, The flow of the explanation is also very smooth, the writing on the blackboard is not ugly, and easy to understand. Personally, I think the score is not particularly sweet, but it is not difficult to get it. If you work hard, 80+ must be no problem, and the overall score is full.",197,243,0,1,0.9994307160377502
630cf1be40e337e60fce0d47,老師實體上課還算用心，有安排同學比賽練習，也會親自示範動作，原本每隔禮拜都蠻期待這堂課。但是「時窮節乃現」，宣布遠距兩個禮拜後，老師沒有任何授課作為，只有請同學自行觀看桌球相關影片，待實體上課時再討論心得。宣布遠距到期末後，貼了兩段影片請同學觀看然後寫六百字心得，這學期就這樣結束了。隔壁排球課還會開會議看影片講解，朱昌勇老師卻將最後五堂課都浪費掉無所作為。如果考上政大是上這樣的體育課，如果前國手授課的體育課是長這樣，如果繳學費是上這樣的體育課，那只能說我很失望。,"The teacher is quite attentive in the physical class. He arranges for the students to practice in competitions, and also demonstrates the movements in person. Originally, I was looking forward to this class every week. But ""the time is poor and the season is now"", two weeks after the announcement of the distance, the teacher did not do anything to teach, but asked the students to watch the billiard-related videos by themselves, and discuss their experiences after the actual class. After announcing the end of the distance, I posted two videos for students to watch and then wrote 600 words of experience. This semester ended like this. The volleyball class next door will hold a meeting to watch the video explanation, but Mr. Zhu Changyong wasted the last five classes and did nothing. If I was admitted to National Chengchi University to take this kind of physical education class, if the physical education class taught by the former national player is like this, if I pay the tuition fee to take this kind of physical education class, then I can only say that I am very disappointed.",265,200,0,1,0.0025429129600524902

630cf1be40e337e60fce0c58,記得期初有說過不用上台報告，期中曾有說過因遠距所以取消報告，但在期末突然說要上台報告會讓同學有點慌亂，希望老師能夠在期初的教學大綱說明清楚～,"I remember that at the beginning of the semester, I said that I don’t need to report on stage, and in the middle of the semester, I said that the report was canceled due to the distance, but at the end of the semester, I suddenly said that I would give a report on stage, which would make the students a little flustered.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0cb5,俊良老師人很好，每次有關作業，考試的時間都會和同學們商量，會考量假期的時候，小考延遲一周之類的。 老師上課很認真，雖然真的很難很難很難，但還是很認真在聽課了,"Teacher Junliang is very kind. Every time he discusses with his classmates about homework and exam time, he will consider the delay of the quiz for one week during the holidays and so on.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0cfa,老師用鳥瞰式的教學方式讓我對於刑法可以更容易的了解。但如果有個小地方可以改善就更好了，就是老師會講各方的見解還有自己的看法，但希望在最後老師可以再做一個結論或是整理，包括希望考試怎麼寫，或是差別在哪裡，因為我常常聽到最後，會抓不到方向～ 這一年下來在刑法方面的知識有大幅的增加，不僅是了解學說的爭議或是一些修法的背景，老師都說得很清楚，尤其老師在一些例子上的闡述會用比較有趣有共鳴的方式讓我們思考，而且之前實體課時老師也會跟我們互動，讓我們主動去動腦思考！謝謝老師這一年的指導！,"The teacher used a bird's-eye view teaching method to make it easier for me to understand the criminal law. But it would be even better if there is a small area that can be improved, that is, the teacher will talk about the opinions of various parties and his own views, but I hope that the teacher can make a conclusion or sort out at the end, including how to write the test, or the difference Where, because I often hear that at the end, I will not be able to grasp the direction~ This year, the knowledge of criminal law has increased significantly, not only to understand the controversy of theories or the background of some law amendments, the teacher has made it very clear, especially The teacher's explanations on some examples will make us think in a more interesting and resonant way, and the teacher will also interact with us during the physical class before, let us take the initiative to use our brains to think!

630cf1be40e337e60fce0d49,希望老師可以一開始就幫大家分好倆倆為一組的桌球組別(不要讓我們各自找 可能會因為在這裡沒有認識的人所以找不到)也希望老師可以在開始前以一對一對打的方式了解大部分同學的程度並進行分組。因為若是倆倆為一組進行對打時，可能會有partner彼此程度不同的問題發生，那這樣就會影響到對方的成績。或是老師也可以選擇用單人跟老師打的方式，去進行成績評估。,"I hope the teacher can help you divide the billiards into groups of two at the beginning (don’t let us find each other because we may not be able to find it because we don’t know anyone here) I also hope that the teacher can use one-on-one before the start The way of sparring is to understand the level of most of the students and group them. Because if two people are fighting in a group, there may be problems with different levels of partners, which will affect the other party's performance.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0ccf,老師很棒很有趣，但上課的時候常常把我們想得太厲害，跳了很多步驟的思考ಥ_ಥ好啦也有可能是我資質駑鈍所以才聽不懂🥲,"The teacher is great and very interesting, but in class, he often thinks too much about us, skipping a lot of steps in thinking ಥ_ಥ Well, maybe it’s because I’m not very qualified, so I don’t understand🥲",772,241,0,2,0.0014390349388122559

630cf1be40e337e60fce0c64,老師講課幽默風趣、上課內容深且廣，讓許多本來對西班牙文就有興趣的學生更加著迷，也讓學生們有了口說書寫寫西班牙文的能力，運用各種學習到的國際知識，來觀察、界定我們的世界，使我們透過不同的濾鏡與學術思想萊看到我們周圍世界不同的樣貌與型態。很開心能夠修習到這門課，謝謝所有助教和老師，謝謝。,"The teacher's lectures are humorous and interesting, and the content of the class is deep and broad, which fascinates many students who are already interested in Spanish. It also enables students to have the ability to speak, write and write Spanish, and use all kinds of international knowledge they have learned to observe , Define our world, so that we can see different appearances and forms of the world around us through different filters and academic thoughts.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0d06,老師要閱讀我們繳回的作業量很龐大，但每週都用心、充分備課。為了給學生多樣充足的學習資源，各方邀請講者，感覺得出來真的很用心規劃工作坊。前面幾週的翻譯理論讓我對翻譯有了更全面的理解和視角，不會只是傻傻地翻。老師也不吝嗇分享作為譯者的經驗談，覺得能有老師這個譯者前輩很幸運！我從回饋單得到了不少正面回饋，讓我很滿足也更有信心，也得以思考其他翻譯的可能性，避免被侷限住。如果沒修過這堂課就出去做翻譯的話，我應該會很心虛吧，雖然還是有很多不足，但更有概念了。謝謝老師，獲益良多＾＾,"The teacher has to read a huge amount of homework that we have returned, but he prepares lessons carefully and fully every week. In order to provide students with diverse and sufficient learning resources, all parties invited speakers, and it can be felt that they really planned the workshop carefully. The translation theory in the past few weeks has given me a more comprehensive understanding and perspective on translation, and I will not just translate it stupidly. The teacher is not stingy to share his experience as a translator, and he feels very lucky to have a teacher as a senior translator! I got a lot of positive feedback from the feedback sheet, which made me very satisfied and more confident, and I was able to think about other translation possibilities and avoid being limited. If I went out to do translation without taking this course, I would feel very guilty. Although there are still many shortcomings, it is more conceptual. Thank you teacher, I have benefited a lot ^^",876,251,0,3,0.9973370432853699
630cf1be40e337e60fce0d4b,老師真的很認真，每次都會巡迴到每週看大家的動作，並給予建議讓學生能迅速調整動作，而上了這堂課後，覺得自己對桌球又精進不少。,"The teacher is really serious.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0c89,希望老師上課可以在時間的掌握上更加準時，因為常常拖到下課時間，希望可以準時下課。還有像辯論或其他活動，可以先找示範的影片那學生提早看，不然課堂上光弄懂討論時間就大幅減少了，還有預習作業我覺得以個人為主會比較好，團體的預習作業可以是在報告的部分。還有分數的計分可以明確點，不太知道預習作業的分數有些個人有些團體如何計分。,"I hope that the teacher can be more punctual in class, because it is often delayed until the end of class time, and I hope that class can end on time. There are also debates or other activities, you can look for demonstration videos first, and students can watch them early, otherwise the time for discussion in class will be greatly reduced. There are also preview assignments. I think it is better to focus on individuals, and group preview assignments Can be in the report section. There is also the scoring of scores that can be clarified. I don’t know how some individuals and groups score the scores of the preview assignments.",874,704,0,1,0.0019988417625427246
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c93,老師上課會提一些歷史上或是當下時事的經濟學相關事件，也會給幾篇參考文章讓同學對經濟學有更多了解,"The teacher will mention some economics-related events in history or current affairs in class, and will also give a few reference articles to let students know more about economics",99,268,0,1,0.9572663307189941

630cf1be40e337e60fce0ce8,老師很棒！能加強學生信心！ 學校球桌有限，希望在修課人數上再做微調，超過兩人一桌會降低學習效果。,"The teacher is great! Can strengthen students' confidence!

630cf1be40e337e60fce0cc8,老師很可愛，上課常常用嚴肅的語氣講好笑的話，讓無聊的行政法有了一絲的有趣。但老師上課的範圍真的太多了，尤其是因為只考一次期末考，所以同學要更注意自己的讀書狀況，需要很快。,"The teacher is very cute, and he often speaks funny words in a serious tone in class, which makes the boring administrative law a little bit interesting.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0d56,我覺得老師本身是不可多得的好老師，備課會適時加入不同題材，不僅在課堂上會回答學生的問題，在課後也很關心學生，願意花時間和學生分享自己的經驗，給予生涯上的建議。不過有時候會覺得課程內容沒什麼記憶點，還沒上完課就忘了，可能是因為課程內容太多，只能飛快地講，上課時沒什麼自己一邊書寫重點一邊思考的機會，我想老師可以將相關章節的重點融合在一起，不需要完全依照課本脈絡。另外也可以適度刪減簡報內容，不需要做的那麼詳盡，留一點讓學生記筆記的空間，這樣比較能夠幫助記憶，只是需課前就提供簡報。,"I think the teacher himself is a rare good teacher. He will add different themes in time when preparing lessons. He will not only answer students' questions in class, but also care about students after class. He is willing to spend time with students. suggestion. However, sometimes I feel that the content of the course is not memorable, and I forget it before the end of the class. It may be because the course content is too much, so I can only speak quickly. There is no chance to write the key points and think about it in class. I think the teacher can Integrate the main points of related chapters together, and don't need to follow the textbook line exactly. In addition, the content of the briefing can also be moderately deleted. It does not need to be so detailed, leaving a little space for students to take notes, which can help memory, but the briefing is provided before class.",9,705,0,1,0.009499430656433105

630cf1be40e337e60fce0caa,老師對該課程及學生相當負責任;在學習知識的同時也能聽到許多實際發生過的經濟事件，使我在學習相關理論時能更加融會貫通。,"The teacher is very responsible for the course and the students; while learning knowledge, he can also hear many economic events that actually happened, which made me more integrated when learning related theories.",99,268,0,1,0.998658299446106
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c2e,老師有些原則真的有別於正常教學的原則，他不讓同學在課堂上看手機，真的瞄一下都不行，有時候是因為想查外語的意思，但因為看手機就會被警告。大家都是大學生，這個限制就好像然小學生不能在班上講話一樣。還有不用政大Moodle,"Some principles of the teacher are really different from those of normal teaching. He does not allow students to look at their mobile phones in class, even if they really glance at them. Sometimes it is because they want to look up the meaning in a foreign language, but they will be warned if they look at their mobile phones. Everyone is a college student, and this restriction is like the fact that primary school students cannot speak in class. And don't use Zhengda Moodle",862,222,0,3,0.533201277256012
630cf1be40e337e60fce0cc3,老師講得很清楚，只不過我的慧根不夠...老師期末會調分，這是一大善舉！,"The teacher explained it very clearly, but my wisdom is not enough... The teacher will adjust the grades at the end of the semester, which is a great act of kindness!",197,243,0,1,0.9995837807655334

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0d9d,感謝老師這學期的授課，受益良多，除了荀子相關內容，也有很多哲學或其他領域的知識，真的非常精彩！！！！,"Thanks to the teacher for teaching this semester, I have benefited a lot.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0c9e,上課課程規劃清晰，讓學生能夠明確的根據課程進行預習或複習，另外老師上課提供錄製上課內容也使能夠方便於課後複習，老師在每次上課前也會進行課程複習，讓課程銜接更連貫，也有很多助教能夠解答題目的疑惑,"The class planning is clear, so that students can clearly preview or review according to the course. In addition, the teacher provides recorded lecture content in class to facilitate review after class. The teacher will also review the course before each class to make the course connection more coherent , there are also many teaching assistants who can answer the questions",99,268,0,1,0.9960153698921204
630cf1be40e337e60fce0d44,老師教學認真，會適時給予稱讚，和改善動作的指教。 遠距上課後要求學生看的影片，希望可以先告知要在上課時間看完，本來自己想另外安排時間看，發現老師傳的影片已經被刪除，現在還在想辦法要怎麼完成這個作業。,"The teacher is serious in teaching, and will give timely praise and advice on improving movements. The video that students are required to watch after remote class, I hope you can tell me to watch it during the class time. I originally wanted to arrange another time to watch it, but found that the video sent by the teacher has been deleted, and I am still trying to figure out how to complete this assignment.",265,200,0,1,0.10347968339920044
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c86,課程內容豐富，但課堂小組討論時間有點太短就要發表，很吃組員能力，希望老師能多給一點時間，謝謝您,"The content of the course is rich, but the classroom group discussion time is a bit too short to be published. It is very difficult for the team members' ability. I hope the teacher can give me more time. Thank you",874,704,0,1,0.0010085701942443848
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c82,老師人很好，也常常下來看大家都動作、做調整 有時剛聽老師講解可能會覺得模糊、不太能領會，不過或許是因為運動類別的姿勢跟操作還是得透過練習才能了解，就打打看就對了！XD 雙打比賽很有趣也很刺激~,"The teacher is very nice, and I often come down to see everyone's movements and make adjustments. Sometimes I may feel vague and difficult to understand after listening to the teacher's explanation, but it may be because the posture and operation of the sports category can only be understood through practice.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0d18,老師的課程不會讓人覺得負擔很重，但內容卻十分充實且有趣，也鼓勵學生多加運動，不以實力程度為準則，而以認真的程度為考量，謝謝老師(老詩人很好，學生可以勇敢發問！),"The teacher's courses will not make people feel that the burden is heavy, but the content is very substantial and interesting.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0ce3,覺得老師人很好 早八課堂很容易累，但有做操環節的話就會醒來！我覺得很棒～ 課程不會太難，沒學過桌球的人也可以蠻開心的～！,"I think the teacher is very nice.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0c95,老師一切都很好，會補充一些和課程內容相關的閱讀文章。但期末考試範圍有點過大。,The teacher is very good and will add some reading articles related to the course content. But the scope of the final exam is a bit too large.,99,268,0,1,0.005124032497406006
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c87,課程內容多元會邀請各領域專家來演講，每週有小組或個人作業，如果對當週主題沒有太大的興趣，偶爾會覺得負擔偏重。,"The content of the course is diverse. Experts in various fields will be invited to give speeches. There are group or individual assignments every week. If you are not very interested in the topic of the week, you will occasionally feel that the burden is too heavy.",874,704,0,1,0.676354706287384

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0d8e,老師人真的很好，我真的好討厭腳下運動，但因為喜歡老師，也相信老師的教學，所以去上課不會那麼痛苦。,"The teacher is really nice, I really hate the movement of my feet, but because I like the teacher and believe in the teacher's teaching, going to class will not be so painful.",321,244,0,1,0.9985694885253906

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0dbb,考試座位的安排不當，希望能先行至該教室查看後再做分配。,"The arrangement of the test seats is not appropriate, I hope that I can go to the classroom to check and then make an assignment.",879,255,0,1,0.00036394596099853516
630cf1be40e337e60fce0c8a,幾乎每堂課都是邀請講者演講與討論，導致沒有基礎的理論的學習。且大部分課程主題聚焦在國內的環境議題上，主題過於單一且缺乏全球化的精神。每堂課需繳交的預習作業和要看的文本內容越來越多，反而讓學生無法好好吸收，也降低學生的學習熱忱。,"Almost every class is invited to give lectures and discussions, resulting in learning without basic theory. And most course themes focus on domestic environmental issues, the theme is too single and lacks the spirit of globalization. There are more and more preview assignments and texts to be read in each class, which prevents students from absorbing them well and reduces their enthusiasm for learning.",874,704,0,1,0.0003358125686645508

630cf1be40e337e60fce0cb7,老師很會講課，能把微積分講的淺顯易懂。上課方式是自己寫板書，讓每一章節都有濃縮精華，可以抄下來作觀念接觸以及考前複習。順便告白助教很可愛。,"The teacher is very good at lecturing, and can explain calculus in a simple and easy-to-understand manner.

630cf1be40e337e60fce0c8c,每周上課的主題都相差甚遠，也沒有連貫性，對於所謂的連結國際的全球化也未多作說明，整學期下來會不清楚這堂課在上什麼。,"The themes of the classes every week are very different, and there is no coherence, and there is no explanation for the so-called globalization that connects the world. After the whole semester, it will be unclear what this class is about.",874,704,0,1,0.0010378360748291016

630cf1be40e337e60fce0d54,老師很認真，但笑話有點冷，希望之後笑話可以更好笑一點XD,"The teacher is very serious, but the joke is a bit cold, I hope the joke can be more funny in the future XD",9,705,0,1,0.0015436410903930664
630cf1be40e337e60fce0cf8,老師這學期的進度有點慢啊......因為上學期老師採「鳥瞰式」教學，所以這學期很多講過的內容又再重複聽一次，導致進度落後許多。希望老師對課程的安排能夠符合刑法(二)本應該教到的範圍內。也掌握好上課的時間與不要偏題。但老師有些獨到的見解是教科書所上學不到的，很值得聆聽。,"The progress of the teacher this semester is a bit slow...Because the teacher adopted a ""bird's-eye view"" teaching method last semester, so many of the content that was taught this semester were repeated again, resulting in a lot of lag behind the progress. I hope that the teacher's arrangement of the courses can be in line with the scope of the criminal law (2) that should be taught. Also master the time of class and don't deviate from the topic. But the teacher has some unique insights that cannot be learned in textbooks, and are worth listening to.",873,238,0,1,0.005689263343811035

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0dbf,上課涵蓋內容太少，以外系學生的角度來看 其實資管系學生的程式能力範圍有點令人堪憂 建議老師不要理會 以後不會往資訊領域的學生 的意見（一直喊太難） 政大資管真的快要什麼都不會了... 程式本來就應該要自學，老師能做的只有帶給學生學習地圖 剩下的應該要自己學會 說真的商學院的基本科目真的負擔不重，要兼顧程式設計跟四大基礎科目（經、統、會、微） 不會很難，老師請加油,"The class covers too little content. From the perspective of foreign students, the programming ability of students in the Department of Assets and Management is a bit worrying. It is recommended that the teacher ignore the opinions of students who will not go to the field of information in the future (it is too difficult to shout) Zhengda Assets Management really It’s almost impossible to know anything... The program should be self-study, the teacher can only give the students a learning map, and the rest should be learned by themselves. To be honest, the basic subjects of the business school are really not heavy.

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0e16,老師鼓勵大學生需要具備自學的能力，學習要靠自己不能靠別人！追求esg的同時，也要注重正式的書面報告，因此無論是word書面或是ppt都要列印出來，並且郵寄至老師家裡，十分感謝老師教導學生這些出社會後的眉眉角角，是大學四年來收穫最多的一門課！,"The teacher encourages college students to have the ability of self-study, learning depends on themselves and not on others!

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0e07,上課都是照著那些錯誤百出的PPT唸，很多事項或進度都很臨時才公布。讓外面業務來演講順便做業績的事就更扯....業務演講前都沒說明什麼，就叫學生掃QR code，一進去才發現是他們的投資群組，學生在裡面質疑他、提出疑問還被嗆，不希望課堂淪為這種人拉客的地方==,"Classes are read according to those PPTs full of mistakes, and many matters or progress are announced only temporarily.

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0e19,完全沒有任何優點。考試的部分太過分了，學生儘管讀了很多書，一份期末考做了6個小時也做不完，另外整堂課的Loading也過重，且這些Loading完全沒有任何實質上的幫助，Tableau的教學也失焦，沒有交到真正用來分析的工具，只交了怎麼拉圖表，我還不如上YouTube 上自己學習就遠超課堂上的內容。,"There is absolutely no advantage whatsoever. The part of the exam is too much. Although students read a lot of books, they can’t finish a final exam after 6 hours. In addition, the loading of the whole class is too heavy, and these loadings have no real help at all. Tableau’s The teaching was also out of focus.

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0f0f,這學期的前半段，講得太久了，尤其是針對上學期複習的部分，實在是不需要花太多時間著墨，同學要為自己的學習負責，若是不能自主預習與複習，聽不懂是學生自己的問題。另外感覺後半段在學高會是在學怎麼做分錄而已，或是說是在記憶高會，並不是在理解高會，有點痛苦。,"In the first half of this semester, I have been talking for too long, especially for the review part of the previous semester. I really don’t need to spend too much time writing on it. Students should be responsible for their own learning. students' own questions.

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0e64,自從遠距後，每次上課都會從某個時段開始，老師的簡報忘記換頁，大家也不好意思提醒，所以就真的只能當podcast聽了。只能說幸好老師幾乎沒有板書，所以如果認真聽或自己讀得來的話，簡報有無換頁也無妨。,"Since the distance, each class will start at a certain time, and the teacher forgot to change the page of the briefing, and everyone is embarrassed to remind, so I really can only listen to it as a podcast.

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0f17,老師人很好，很尊重學生的意見，但我覺得上課教材方面待改進。這就很像國高中，我們自己念完書再把密密麻麻的課本拿去教別人，效果不太好，每次上課都覺得自己好像學了很多但沒有一個系統的感覺（也有可能是我太笨），但感受得出來老師很用心教學，很想要我們真的懂，雖然老師強調的快樂學習對已經被會計摧殘三年的人真的很搞笑因為我們明知道不可能，但偶爾的笑話還是滿好笑的。希望老師不要太被網路上的匿名言論影響，閒話永遠有人在傳，做到問心無愧就夠了，太執著於外人評價有時候也搞的自己灰頭土臉。,"The teachers are very nice and respect the opinions of the students, but I think the teaching materials need to be improved. This is very similar to national high school. We finish our studies and then take the dense textbooks to teach others. The effect is not very good. Every time we go to class, we feel that we have learned a lot but there is no system (maybe I am too stupid) ), but it can be felt that the teacher is very attentive in teaching and wants us to really understand. Although the happy learning emphasized by the teacher is really funny to those who have been tortured by accounting for three years because we know it is impossible, but the occasional joke is still It's funny. I hope that the teacher will not be too affected by the anonymous comments on the Internet. Gossip will always be spread, and it is enough to have a clear conscience. Too much obsession with outsiders' evaluation sometimes makes me feel ashamed.",888,258,0,1,0.0934218168258667

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0f1c,這堂課採用非同步遠距跟實體交錯的上課方式，但是非同步遠距的週都只是把教材(只有一次是不到一小時的教學錄影，剩下都是文字與圖片教材)丟上來讓同學自己讀就沒了，而且實體教學的週教的還是之前丟上來的教材，等於只上了半學期的課，但又有很多作業。 excel的實體課教得還不錯，但是只教了一點就要我們做期中報告實在感覺不好，access幾乎只教了打開檔案而已，結果在這堂課學到的東西真的很少。,"This class adopts asynchronous distance and physical interleaving teaching methods, but the asynchronous distance week only throws the teaching materials (only one time is less than an hour of teaching video, and the rest are text and picture teaching materials) The students were gone after reading it by themselves, and Zhou, who taught in the physical teaching, still taught the textbooks thrown up before, which meant that he had only attended half a semester of class, but he had a lot of homework. The entity class of excel is not bad, but it feels bad to ask us to do a mid-term report after only a little bit of teaching.

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0f14,我認為老師的教學風格並不適合教授進階的會計課程，上課花時間抱怨同學在網路上對他的負評不僅無助學生學習也會造成學生上課無形的壓力．,"I think the teacher's teaching style is not suitable for teaching advanced accounting courses.

In addition, I also hope that the teacher can announce the date of the exam (including the time of the midterm exam and the quiz) earlier, because it may be too late to review if it is announced too late, and not only the senior meeting has to be reviewed, but we also need to arrange time to review other courses.",888,258,0,1,0.0009049177169799805

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0ea2,希望老師能夠尊重學生，請避免向女同學開不適當的玩笑，每個人對玩笑的接受程度不同，來上課我不認為學生有需要接受老師的不正確言行，另外，老師若要在自由運動時間主動指導學生動作的話，請盡量做到教育每位同學，而不是只找固定的幾位的少數同學。最後，能理解人有好惡程度之分，但身為一個老師希望請盡量做到公平，以上是上課觀察和幾句建言。,"I hope the teacher can respect the students. Please avoid making inappropriate jokes to female students. Everyone accepts jokes differently. I don’t think students need to accept the teacher’s incorrect words and deeds when they come to class. If you take the initiative to guide students' actions, please try to educate every student instead of just finding a few fixed students.

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0f15,林老師真的很努力在上課 但學生吸收效果很有限  就高會內容來說 林老師顯得沒有婉瑩老師熟悉 比較少直接提點關鍵處  反而有時候和課本要表達的觀念有些落差 直接帶題目的話有些後面的題目沒有課文的觀念也無法做 導致後來也是要自己看(題目比課文容易 學生看不懂課文較多而不是題目) 浪費蠻多時間,"Teacher Lin is really working hard in class, but the effect of students’ absorption is very limited. As far as the content of the high-level meeting is concerned, Teacher Lin is not as familiar as Teacher Wanying. Some of the later topics can’t be done without the concept of the text, so you have to read it by yourself later (the topic is easier than the text, and students can’t understand the text more than the topic), which wastes a lot of time",888,258,0,1,0.0006423592567443848

I am really lucky to be able to sign up for this course, and the teaching assistant Zheng Er is really super serious, self-compiled teaching lecture notes and compiling clear and easy-to-understand textbook explanations, and also caring about the students' learning situation, it is really the best I have ever encountered The most attentive teaching assistant~ I believe that if you study hard, you will definitely learn a lot in this course, and the exam will not deliberately dampen students' confidence.

Compared with the introduction to East Asian Sinology, this class is really much easier (but you can’t do it casually). A major feature of this class is the need to prepare a class report.

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0fa4,我覺得男女考試標準要不同，因為本來肌肉和身體構造就不同，因此體育能力也不同,"I think the test standards for men and women should be different, because the muscles and body structure are different, so the physical ability is also different",889,281,0,1,0.9840428233146667

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0ebb,這兩學期可以感受到林禹銘老師是真心為學生著想的，真的是好老師。期末考部分範圍有點太大，而且個案部分希望課堂上能稍微提及，不然對電腦不好的同學很吃力。,"In the past two semesters, I can feel that Mr. Lin Yuming really cares about the students, and he is really a good teacher.

I often use very vivid and interesting examples to bring knowledge points into the classroom to help students remember and get started faster, especially for people like me who are not very good at accounting, and because of this, they can learn accounting faster! And the teacher is also very patient, if you ask the teacher or teaching assistants about things you don’t know, you will get answers quickly, and the teachers and teaching assistants will also encourage us!

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0fa1,最後一堂課的討論環節很有趣，但是討論的時間和文本量太不夠讓人消化了，即便少數同學可以跟的上但多數通學處在剛讀完就要上台的狀態。這個環節很有意義，但可能要減少文本的量，或是攤純討論上課的概念會比較好(自己的小意見)。,"The discussion in the last class was very interesting, but the time and amount of text for the discussion were not enough for people to digest. Even if a few students could follow up, most Tongxue students were in the state of going to the stage just after reading.

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0ee4,可以感覺老師很用心想要教給我們很多東西，但整學期上下來會覺得抓不到課程重點。前兩個禮拜在講國中已經學過的馬斯洛需求理論還有本我自我超我、後來又帶入深訪但也教得很淺、再者又帶入文案撰寫的要點，課程內容包羅萬象但在一堂課裡就是甚麼都摸一點而已，希望老師可以更具焦在某個領域或主題。,"It can be felt that the teacher is very hard to teach us a lot of things, but after the whole semester, I feel that I can't grasp the key points of the course. Maslow’s needs theory, self-superego and self-superego that I have learned in the first two weeks of lectures, and then brought in-depth interviews but also taught very shallowly, and then brought in the key points of copywriting. The course content is all-encompassing But in a class, I just touch a little bit of everything. I hope the teacher can focus more on a certain field or theme.",894,267,0,3,0.4408028721809387
630cf1bf40e337e60fce0f4b,真的很棒的一堂課！我學會更照顧和關注自己的心理狀態，並透過自主學習計畫去嘗試了自己一直想做的事情。謝謝老師和助教！,"Really great class!

In addition to teaching N4-5 everyone’s Japanese, I also added N2 sentence patterns. I think I have learned a lot in the past two years. I also said that I can ask her questions in the future.

630cf1c040e337e60fce10ae,老師好我是宜佳，希望可以透過教學意見的管道向您道謝，真的很感謝老師兩學期以來很辛勤用心的教學，每次感受您上課前花了多少時間備課、準備講義，都真的覺得很愧疚自己複習成管會的時間遠不及您。雖然可能班上對您有一些些比較負面的評價，可是還是希望您可以知道您真的上的很好！而且本來就不是老師該迎合學生，學生的本分就是適應每個老師獨特的教學風格，我非常喜歡您上課的互動，也真的對成本管理會計燃起了更多的興趣，未來希望可以在這個領域繼續努力，非常榮幸在大二這年當您的學生！謝謝老師！,"Hello, teacher. I am Yijia. I hope I can thank you through the channel of teaching opinions. I really appreciate the teacher’s hard work and dedication in teaching in the past two semesters. Every time I feel how much time you spent preparing lessons and handouts before class, I really appreciate it. I feel ashamed that I have not spent as much time as you in reviewing the management meeting. Although there may be some negative comments on you in the class, I still hope that you can know that you are really doing well! Moreover, it is not the teacher's job to cater to the students. The duty of the students is to adapt to each teacher's unique teaching style. I really like the interaction in your class, and I have really ignited more interest in cost management accounting. Continue to work hard in this field, and it is a great honor to be your student in my sophomore year! Thank you, teacher!",841,284,0,1,0.9993379712104797

630cf1c040e337e60fce10ad,老師很認真準備教材，上課會希望學生事先預習，也會課堂點名同學回答問題。對於不喜歡在課堂上發言的同學分數上相對吃虧，而我們並不是不喜歡與老師互動，而是比較熟悉且習慣上課的模式是老師講解、學生聽講，畢竟這堂是專業課程而非討論性質的課程；此外課堂上的提問或突襲小考經常還沒吸收思考完畢就丟給學生，經常讀到有問題也是在課後練習題目時才會發現，因此課堂上的突襲考題，到最後有些同學(並非單指我)不會寫乾脆不交作答紙出去，若以此計分的話，實是扭曲老師原先的美意，令人感到相當可惜!,"The teacher prepares the teaching materials very carefully. In class, students are expected to preview in advance, and they will also call students to answer questions in class. Students who don’t like to speak in class are at a disadvantage in terms of scores, and it’s not that we don’t like interacting with teachers, but we are more familiar with and accustomed to the teaching mode of teachers explaining and students listening. After all, this class is a professional course rather than a discussion In addition, the questions or surprise quizzes in the classroom are often thrown to the students before they have finished absorbing and thinking. They often find out that there are problems in the readings when they practice the questions after class. (Not just me) If I can’t write, I just don’t hand in the answer sheet. If this is used to score, it will distort the teacher’s original good intentions, which is a pity!",841,284,0,1,0.0008262991905212402
630cf1c040e337e60fce0fe0,這是一堂超好玩的體育課! 雖然比起很多體育課活動量算大，但是完全不會超出負荷~課程中很多有趣的小組遊戲，超級好玩!老師很用心的希望讓體育課變得好玩，真的很用心!,"This is a super fun physical education class! Although compared with many physical education classes, the amount of activities is relatively large, but it will not be overloaded at all~ There are many interesting group games in the class, which is super fun!

630cf1c040e337e60fce0fe9,William是教學很認真的老師～這學期的課程設計有比較深入文化的部分，但還是很希望可以有更有系統的課程講義（如：補充單字），比較希望從這堂課獲得這樣的能力，可以和外國人討論文化或政治等深入議題。不過老師也會根據課程進度彈性調整，這點很棒，不會負擔很大。,"William is a very serious teacher~ The course design of this semester has a more in-depth cultural part, but I still hope that there will be more systematic course handouts (such as: supplementary words), and I hope to gain such abilities from this class. You can discuss in-depth issues such as culture or politics with foreigners. However, the teacher will also adjust flexibly according to the progress of the course, which is great and will not burden you too much.",899,288,3,3,0.998823344707489
630cf1c040e337e60fce0fea,課堂上可以有更多和「不同」同學討論的機會,"There are more opportunities to discuss with ""different"" students in class",899,288,3,3,0.9920390844345093

630cf1c040e337e60fce104c,我蠻喜歡這堂課的，可以運動到又很好玩，但我覺得老師可以調整某幾堂課的內容，比如說可能在期中或期末前幾堂課改成自主練習（在課堂中），這樣就不會讓學生覺得有練習不夠的問題，因為老師每一堂幾乎都會教不同的東西，但考試會有兩個人一組的情況，如果和自己的隊友沒有足夠的時間培養默契和練習，考試的成績可能就會不太理想，還有，雖然這學期改為遠距教學，但我覺得後面如果每堂課都在比賽的話，會減少練習的時間，也比較難知道每次比賽不好的點在哪並進行改善。,"I really like this class, it’s very fun to exercise, but I think the teacher can adjust the content of some classes, for example, maybe change it to independent exercises (in the class) in the middle or the first few classes before the end of the term, so that Students will not feel that there is not enough practice, because the teacher will teach different things in each class, but there will be two people in the exam. If there is not enough time to cultivate tacit understanding and practice with your teammates, the exam In addition, although this semester has been changed to distance learning, I think that if there are competitions in every class in the future, the practice time will be reduced, and it will be more difficult to know whether each competition is not good. Find out where it is and make improvements.",321,281,0,1,0.0021001100540161133
630cf1c040e337e60fce10af,其實蠻喜歡個案討論，卻因為錯誤解讀教學評論而少了很多，有點可惜,"In fact, I really like case discussions, but because of misinterpretation of teaching comments, I lost a lot, which is a pity",841,284,0,1,0.00038170814514160156
630cf1c040e337e60fce105d,老師設計的遊戲很有趣 可惜遠距 不然很想踢球,"The game designed by the teacher is very interesting, but it is a pity that it is far away, otherwise I really want to play football",321,281,0,1,0.0009763240814208984
630cf1c040e337e60fce10a5,老師很鼓勵大家上課發言及思考，我覺得這點很好，但有時候可能會因為太多的舉手發言導致進度落後，所以可以再稍微評估一下發表時間。,"The teacher encourages everyone to speak and think in class. I think this is very good, but sometimes the progress may fall behind due to too many raised hands to speak, so you can evaluate the time of publication a little bit.",841,284,0,1,0.006519675254821777

630cf1c040e337e60fce0fdb,在學期初兩堂課與上課地點更動時公告在moodle上提醒上課地點,"In the first two classes at the beginning of the semester and when the class location is changed, the announcement will remind the class location on moodle",366,281,0,1,0.9929172992706299

630cf1bf40e337e60fce0f2b,前三次的小考有人現場考、有人帶回家考，在公平性上是可以供老師未來開課時討論。,"In the first three quizzes, some people took the test on the spot and some took it home. In terms of fairness, it can be discussed by teachers in future classes.",343,259,2,1,0.9951489567756653

630cf1c040e337e60fce100d,老師超讚，補充很多發展歷史來讓我們了解當時相關的背景，更能理解教科書裡面提到的內容。,"The teacher is amazing, adding a lot of development history to let us understand the relevant background at that time, and better understand the content mentioned in the textbook.",901,293,0,3,0.9998548030853271
630cf1c040e337e60fce1017,內容廣泛多元，但教課方式可能有點發散，如果是對介紹的國家背景不了解的同學，可能比較難吸收。,"The content is extensive and diverse, but the teaching methods may be a bit divergent. It may be difficult for students who do not know the background of the country introduced.",375,292,0,1,0.010786592960357666

630cf1c040e337e60fce0fe4,之後在貼google meet 連結的時候可能要請老師把代碼前的空格去掉，不然每次要加入會議時都會顯示是無效網址,"In the future, when posting the google meet link, you may have to ask the teacher to remove the space before the code, otherwise it will be displayed as an invalid URL every time you want to join the meeting",897,712,0,3,0.00031948089599609375

630cf1c040e337e60fce103d,這學期的課收穫良多，但報告跟作業的量真的好多。另外像Rap這種比較特別的音樂類型，要求學生每個都要作詞跟唱，實屬太難，建議未來不要有這種活動。課程其餘部分都很完美。,"This semester's class has gained a lot, but the amount of reports and homework is really a lot. In addition, for a relatively special type of music like Rap, it is too difficult to require students to compose lyrics and sing along.

630cf1c040e337e60fce1010,希望老師在講解各國歷史背景上可以簡略帶過，後面政治制度的部分才有比較多的時間，畢竟在比較政府與政治這堂課上學生可能會想要多了解各國政治系統內部的運作，才能進一步做各國的比較，以上僅做為建議，老師及助教在教學上都很認真。,"I hope that the teacher can briefly explain the historical background of various countries, so that there will be more time for the political system later. After all, in the class of comparing governments and politics, students may want to learn more about the internal operation of the political systems of various countries.

630cf1c040e337e60fce1013,我覺得辯論的形式需要改進，我覺得除了辯論的那兩組同學，其他同學在他們辯論的課堂上其實能吸收的東西並不多。一來是因為我們不像老師助教對該辯題有一定程度了解，二來我們手邊也沒有他們的書面資料，第三，老師又從來不要求報告組別表達能力，有些組員上台就是一股腦地快速把資料念完，老師基本上評論的時候也不會說這樣不好，老師真的覺得台下從沒接觸過相關議題的同學可以立即吸收嗎？然後因為同學的報告已經吸收不好了，老師評論補充的效果也會減少。基本上對辯題的理解都來自書面，辯論課只讓人覺得浪費時間。,"I think the form of the debate needs to be improved. I think that apart from the two groups of students who are debating, the other students can actually absorb not much in their debating class. Firstly, it’s because we don’t have a certain level of understanding of the debate topic like teachers and assistants. Second, we don’t have their written materials at hand. Third, the teacher never asks to report on the group’s ability to express. After reading the material, the teacher will basically not say that it is not good when commenting. Does the teacher really think that students who have never been exposed to related topics can immediately absorb it? Then, because the students' reports have not been absorbed well, the effect of the teacher's comments and supplements will also be reduced. Basically, the understanding of debate topics comes from writing, and the debate class just makes people feel like a waste of time.",375,292,0,1,0.0002619624137878418

630cf1c040e337e60fce0fd6,這堂課很好玩，但有時候會滿累的。而且常常因為下雨要在雨中踢球或不能踢球覺得滿可惜，不然遠距前的課程都還蠻喜歡的！,"The class is fun, but can be exhausting at times.

630cf1c040e337e60fce0fe6,希望老師在授課講解時可以更清楚，或許有些觀念嗎有這麼容易被理解，但還是希望老師可以盡力地講解讓同學有機會及管道理解，此外，也希望老師可以適時的理解及聆聽學生的想法，在回答同學問題的時候可以更友善及更有耐心一些！,"I hope that the teacher can be more clear when explaining in class. Perhaps some concepts are so easy to understand, but I still hope that the teacher can try his best to explain so that students have the opportunity and channels to understand.

630cf1c040e337e60fce1012,比較的國家太少，每個國家都教的太細，考試題目很多又都考很細，實在很難在時間內完成，負擔也非常大。除期中期末外，還有辯論、報告，準備都非常花時間，總之壓力很大。但老師很認真教，只是希望能夠準時下課，且適時調整內容分配。,"There are too few countries to compare, each country teaches too detailed, and the exam questions are many and the exams are very detailed. It is really difficult to complete within the time, and the burden is also very heavy. In addition to the mid-term and end-of-term, there are debates and reports, and the preparations take a lot of time. In short, there is a lot of pressure.

630cf1c040e337e60fce10b1,比起全然著重在課本的內容，我還是比較喜歡上學期有多一點額外的時事補充，在上課有多一點實務例子的討論，對於整體課程的學習會比較有幫助(絕對不會是浪費時間)。,"Rather than focusing entirely on the content of the textbook, I still prefer to have a little extra current affairs supplement in the last semester, and have a little discussion of practical examples in class, which will be more helpful to the overall course study (it will definitely not be a waste of time) .",841,284,0,1,0.8282197713851929
630cf1c040e337e60fce10e0,除了好，大概也沒有什麼話可說的了，看到老師眼中滿滿對學術的熱情，不知不覺被考試壓得將近熄滅的對中文的熱愛再度燃起。,"Apart from being good, there is probably nothing to say.

630cf1c040e337e60fce1018,謝謝老師這一學期的教導。 建議學弟妹上課過後做成自己的筆記，老師的PPT也最好拍下來，這樣複習時搭配上課筆記才有重點或大綱，不然真的會迷路。 感受到老師的學識淵博，但是時常讓學生無法跟上您的跳躍速度，以至於迷失在您的一句話中。,"Thank you teacher for teaching this semester. It is recommended that students make their own notes after class, and it is best to take pictures of the teacher's PPT, so that there will be key points or outline when reviewing with class notes, otherwise you will really get lost.

630cf1c040e337e60fce10da,老師的詩選上得非常棒！前幾周概述，以及後來的詩作賞析，都十分精采。老師會和同學互動，並妥善地安排作業、報告，全部課程可以說是極為紮實。,"The teacher's poetry selection is very good! The overview of the first few weeks, and the subsequent appreciation of the poems, are excellent. The teacher will interact with the students, and properly arrange homework and reports.

630cf1c040e337e60fce10de,非常喜歡明璋老師的課，講課不乏味內容又豐富，對同學也非常好。但我想建議老師在作業（對聯、絕句）的引導上可以給同學更多範例參考。另外，遠距的講課速度希望可以放慢一些。,"I like teacher Mingzhang's class very much. The lectures are not boring and rich in content, and he is also very kind to the students.

630cf1c040e337e60fce10e6,明璋超有料，上課很用心，課程精實但蠻硬的，作業也不少，認真聽絕對可以很有收穫！,"Mingzhang is very knowledgeable, he is very attentive in class, the courses are concise but quite tough, and there are also a lot of homework, listening carefully can definitely be very rewarding!",900,713,0,1,0.9996745586395264
630cf1c040e337e60fce1019,老師可以更清楚的表達語意，比較聽得懂,The teacher can express the meaning more clearly and understand more,375,292,0,1,0.9976606369018555
630cf1c040e337e60fce10e3,上過明璋老師的課以後，才知道什麼叫做「雖然苦，但是會回甘。」。雖然一開始覺得課程作業量很多，但是實際完成以後才知道這些作業所培養的能力，對於應用在其他中文系課程的領域是非常廣泛的，也讓我第一次在不同課程中感到融會貫通的學習。而期中考的經驗也讓我了解、反省到自己在研讀、複習課堂所學時的問題。老師對於學生的教誨與關心也能讓我們在這門課更加專心且努力，連請假而放掉的課程都會盡力找時間補齊，使同學們每週所投注的三小時課程時間都十分充實，並且樂在其中，獲益良多。,"After attending the class of Teacher Mingzhang, I realized what it means to be ""although it is bitter, but it will be rewarding."" Although I felt that there was a lot of homework in the course at the beginning, it was only after I actually finished that I realized that the abilities cultivated by these homework are very extensive in the fields of other Chinese courses, and it is the first time that I feel integrated in different courses. . The experience of the midterm exam also allowed me to understand and reflect on the problems I had when I was studying and reviewing what I had learned in class. The teacher's teaching and concern for the students can also make us more attentive and hardworking in this class. Even the classes that were missed due to leave will try their best to find time to make up, so that the three hours of class time that students invest in every week are very fulfilling. And enjoy it, benefit a lot.",900,713,0,1,0.9996209144592285
630cf1c040e337e60fce10e5,老師的授課內容非常有料，看得出老師在這堂課的用心。只不過老師在批改課後作業和期中考卷的速度有些緩慢，距離期末考剩兩周的時間，還是沒有拿到期中考卷，使學生難以掌握本課程的成績方向。建議老師在團體報告結束後，能告知小組本次報告的成績，讓學生能明確掌握報告方向。最後，期望老師在出期末考題時，盡量以課程講述內容為主，畢竟考試的用意是評量學生的學習狀況，而不是難倒學生。,"The content of the teacher's lectures is very informative, and we can see the teacher's intentions in this class. It's just that the teacher is a little slow in correcting homework and mid-term exam papers. There are two weeks left before the final exam, and the mid-term exam papers are still not available, making it difficult for students to grasp the direction of the course results. It is recommended that after the group report is over, the teacher can inform the group of the results of this report, so that students can clearly grasp the direction of the report. Finally, I hope that teachers will try their best to focus on the content of the course when they issue the final exam questions. After all, the purpose of the exam is to evaluate the learning status of the students, not to confuse the students.",900,713,0,1,0.03101050853729248

630cf1c040e337e60fce1016,希望老師還是可以盡量把數據圖表放大一點，不要壓縮原圖片比例，避免造成學生判讀圖表之困難。,"I hope that the teacher can try to enlarge the data chart as much as possible, and not compress the original picture ratio, so as to avoid the difficulty for students to interpret the chart.",375,292,0,1,0.03235828876495361
630cf1c040e337e60fce10bd,只要有發表意見，老師都會以鼓勵方式增強我們的信心，不過下學期作業和報告相較上學期多了不少，或許可以斟酌減一點份量,"As long as there is an opinion, the teacher will encourage us to increase our confidence. However, there will be a lot more homework and reports in the next semester compared to the previous semester. Maybe we can consider reducing the weight a little",899,288,3,3,0.08567601442337036

630cf1c040e337e60fce101b,希望不要有辯論或是拉長報告時間，不然每次同學報告都講的很趕，也不知道在講什麼，一節課又過去了，加上每次辯論都有同學在滑水，認真的同學負擔真的很大，我覺得會失去本來設計報告的意義。也希望老師可以準時下課，有時候真的很累了，但又怕錯過什麼而不敢去廁所，最後可以奪推薦一些參考文獻幫助學習,"I hope that there will be no debates or prolonging the report time, otherwise every time the students report, they will speak in a hurry, and they don’t know what they are talking about. One class has passed, and every time there is a debate, some students are water skiing. Serious students The burden is really heavy, and I think it will lose the meaning of designing the report.

630cf1c040e337e60fce1015,是資訊量很龐雜的一門課，覺得學到不少，可惜很多時候老師沒有足夠時間能講授清楚，但還是感謝老師在百忙之中仍能體諒學生並彈性調整內容。大部分同學對辯論賽制並不熟悉，因此辯論很容易陷入輸贏之爭…而缺少推進討論的效果，感覺不要拘泥於原本賽制設定會更好。,"It is a course with a lot of information, and I feel that I have learned a lot. It is a pity that many times the teacher does not have enough time to explain it clearly, but I still thank the teacher for being considerate of the students and adjusting the content flexibly in spite of his busy schedule. Most of the students are not familiar with the debate system, so the debate is easy to fall into a dispute between winners and losers... and lacks the effect of promoting discussions. I feel that it would be better not to stick to the original competition system.",375,292,0,1,0.2903658151626587
630cf1c040e337e60fce100f,我覺得這學期有摘要很不錯 看不懂文章還可以看看同學們的 以免理解錯誤或不夠深入 建議在辯論或報告前可以提點同學重點（注重的點 或從哪裡切入） 以免跑題 最後我有時覺得考題太籠統 希望可以寫精確點,"I think it’s good to have abstracts this semester. If you don’t understand the articles, you can read them to avoid misunderstood or not deep enough suggestions. Before the debate or report, you can mention the students’ key points (points to focus on or where to start) so as not to digress.

630cf1c040e337e60fce1039,期末報告時，可以把這學期學到的知識運用在報告的分析及思考中,"In the final report, you can apply the knowledge you have learned this semester in the analysis and thinking of the report",902,714,0,1,0.9845386743545532
630cf1c040e337e60fce101e,這學期增加助教課時間成效沒有預期的好，每個助教講的內容不一樣，下學期沒換到助教有點可惜。遠距考試好像也是分班不同助教改給分標準有點謎，然後遠距考試學生真的不會比實體輕鬆太多，希望助教在增加難度時可以調整一下，不然即使遠距還是很難寫完或寫好。辯論效果一樣很差，辯士常常在不是重點的地方爭辯很久，結束之後老師常說沒有討論到想要我們講的面向，建議老師可以直接先對於要從哪個角度切入給予提點，也不會大家只是看同學在台上鬧笑話，沒有達到辯論要的效果。,"This semester’s increase in teaching assistants’ class time is not as good as expected. The content taught by each teaching assistant is different. It’s a pity that I didn’t switch to teaching assistants next semester. It seems that the distance test is divided into different classes and the teaching assistant’s grading standard is a bit of a mystery, and the students in the distance test are really not much easier than the physical test. I hope that the teaching assistant can adjust it when the difficulty increases, otherwise it will still be difficult to finish writing even if it is a long distance. or write well. The effect of the debate is also very poor. Debaters often argue for a long time on areas that are not the key points. After the end, the teacher often says that the aspect that we want us to talk about has not been discussed. It is suggested that the teacher can directly give some pointers on which angle to start from, and it will not help everyone Just watching classmates making jokes on stage did not achieve the desired effect of the debate.",375,292,0,1,0.00026804208755493164
630cf1c040e337e60fce10e4,希望老師可以把總體詩作的份量減少並且深入一點講，不然有時候講太快賞析的時候接收有點吃力。希望實體上課時可以把麥克風拿近一點，但老師的學問還是很豐富的～,"I hope that the teacher can reduce the weight of the overall poems and explain them in depth, otherwise sometimes it will be difficult to accept them when they are taught too quickly.

630cf1c040e337e60fce1011,覺得這堂課採用辯論的方式進行報告對於天生不善言詞的同學不利，即使事前準備充足也很影響呈現。此外，辯論的方式也對台下同學吸收內容不利。,"I feel that the way of debate in this class is not good for students who are not good at words, even if they are well prepared in advance, it will affect the presentation. In addition, the way of debate is not conducive to the absorption of content by students in the audience.",375,292,0,1,0.000287473201751709

630cf1c040e337e60fce1176,老師的講義錯誤可能有點多... 例句的講解也不太明確 有時候說法太模稜兩可 學生容易不清楚怎麼使用 上課速度也有點太快 有些文法有點難負荷 跟不太上qq 期末的報告也有點難準備 雖然是因為疫情突然改的   但上課會有很多流行語跟文法的補充!老師人也很親切~,"The teacher's handouts may be a little bit wrong... The explanation of the example sentences is not very clear, sometimes the words are too ambiguous, and the students are not sure how to use them.

630cf1c040e337e60fce1169,1.考試要求過高，失誤容許低，普遍低分的情況有點消磨熱忱。 2.交代事項反覆，使學生誤解而措手不及。（如考試內容和評分標準，當天情形跟之前所講不同，且並非只有一位學生誤解）,"1. The examination requirements are too high, the error tolerance is low, and the generally low scores are a bit of a drain on enthusiasm. 2.

630cf1c040e337e60fce10f8,老師非常用心！也會用音樂、節目片段當例子，幫助我們更熟悉發音變化，但希望上課講義或是相關公告可以再早一點公布（可能2、3天前）這樣比較有充足的時間準備或列印資料，老師辛苦了！,"The teacher is very attentive! I will also use music and program clips as examples to help us become more familiar with pronunciation changes, but I hope that the lecture notes or related announcements can be released earlier (maybe 2 or 3 days ago) so that there is more time to prepare or print materials.

630cf1c040e337e60fce1198,老師教學的非常有條理，上課完通常只需花一些時間就可以複習完了，但可能老師為了進度比較落後的學生花較多的時間重複講同樣觀念，使我覺得進度推得有點慢，雖然老師是為了讓大家都跟上，不過理清並自行吸收知識應該是學生該學習的，其他並沒有甚麼缺點，統計應該是我吸收最快的科目，謝謝老師的教導。,"The teacher's teaching is very organized, and it usually only takes some time to review after class, but the teacher may spend more time repeating the same concept for students who are behind in progress, which makes me feel that the progress is a bit slow, although the teacher It is for everyone to keep up, but sorting out and absorbing knowledge should be what students should learn.

630cf1c040e337e60fce111d,線上模擬聯合國的討論成效真的極低，組長打字的方式常常讓組員不知道該做什麼，對面回覆也需要時間，完全沒有效率，幾乎沒有討論可言,"The effectiveness of online Model United Nations discussions is really low.

The teacher understands the needs of the students and the topics they are interested in, and guides everyone to learn with an encouraging attitude in class, so that people will not be afraid of learning languages, but they will not teach too loosely or too slowly , It is really suitable for the students of Chuhan.",226,297,0,1,0.9995189905166626
630cf1c040e337e60fce1106,老師教得很好，但是希望可以減少缺課的比例，期初有因為老師私人因素停課，後面也因為老師確診而停課，整學期兩次我個人覺得有點多，當然有些是無可避免的情況，因此若之後要停課的話，建議可以用錄影的方式讓同學補課,"The teacher teaches very well, but I hope that the proportion of absenteeism can be reduced. At the beginning of the semester, classes were suspended due to the teacher’s personal factors, and later because of the teacher’s diagnosis. I personally think that twice in the whole semester is a bit too much. Of course, some of them are unavoidable.

630cf1c040e337e60fce11a4,老師辛苦了！ 上統計學前總覺得自己沒辦法負荷，但是老師的教學不但讓我恢復的自信，更引起我學習上的樂趣，素芬老師的統計學真的是我在政大以來上得最有成就感的課程之一。 只要上課專心聽，作業用心寫，考試都不會很刁難。而且大考滿分都會超過100，所以分數完全不用擔心！ 素芬老師的課真的是我目前進政大以來最愛的之一，老師在教學上很有熱忱也很用心，也時常關心學生的學習狀況！ 很感謝老師這學年來的用心教學！,"The teacher has worked hard!

As long as you listen attentively in class and write homework carefully, the exam will not be difficult.

630cf1c040e337e60fce10f1,個人覺得這堂課適合修過較多韓文課程、已經有一定基礎的人來上，比較能夠快速連結到已經熟知的知識（自己只有修過大學外文韓文，有些文法跟名詞就要重頭認識） 老師人很好，也都不吝於分享課堂ppt.筆記。個人認為老師的口條表達上，比較像是一般學生出來兼教家教的感覺，能感受到老師自己真的了解很多，但能具體傳達出來的部分可能就相對少了一點，比較需要心神領會 不過老師人真的很好，知道自己講話語速快，所以很常問會不會太快、或甚至直接再重複一遍。 感謝老師的教導~！,"Personally, I think this class is suitable for people who have taken many Korean courses and have a certain foundation. They can quickly link to the knowledge they already know (I only have a foreign language Korean in college, and some grammar and nouns need to be re-acquainted) Teacher The person is very nice, and he is not afraid to share the class ppt. Notes. Personally, I think the teacher’s expression is more like the feeling of ordinary students who come out and teach tutors. I can feel that the teacher really knows a lot, but the part that can be conveyed in detail may be relatively little, and it needs more understanding. The teacher is really nice and knows that he speaks fast, so he often asks if he is going too fast, or even repeats it directly. Thank you teacher for teaching~!",907,297,0,3,0.9957277774810791

630cf1c040e337e60fce1123,我覺得老師可以給學生更多時間去針對一個議題去訴說自己的想法，之後再於課程中整合各組的想法，讓學生可以看到其他組思考的面向，讓議題的探討可以更完整。,"I think teachers can give students more time to express their own ideas on a topic, and then integrate the ideas of each group in the course, so that students can see the thinking of other groups, so that the discussion of the topic can be more complete.",369,298,0,1,0.8208512663841248

I also like that the teacher uses Korean dramas or Korean TV dramas to show us the application of grammar in real life~",226,297,0,1,0.9972789883613586
630cf1c040e337e60fce11a7,謝謝老師扎實用心的講課，讓我學到打羽球的正確技巧。雖然有些學長姐說老師花太多時間講道理，但我覺得沒那麼誇張，是在合理範圍內，內容也是對我們有幫助的，而且在講解姿勢的時候反而非常清楚，可以知道哪邊容易出錯，對於想學好羽球的初學者來說很需要也很適合。,"Thank you teacher for your solid and earnest lectures, allowing me to learn the correct skills of playing badminton. Although some senior sisters say that the teacher spends too much time explaining the truth, I don’t think it’s that exaggerated. It’s within a reasonable range. The content is also helpful to us, and when explaining the postures, it’s very clear, so we can know which side is easy to make mistakes , It is very necessary and suitable for beginners who want to learn badminton well.",384,300,0,1,0.9996782541275024
630cf1c040e337e60fce110a,老師上課的氣氛很輕鬆，不會讓我們學習韓文的壓力很大。上課還會穿插影片給我們看，讓我們知道這個文法如何在實際上做使用，也會即時的糾正我們一些容易錯誤的發音，並且也會鼓勵我們講得很好，讓我們不會害怕開口說韓文。,"The atmosphere of the teacher's class is very relaxed and will not put us under a lot of pressure to learn Korean. There will also be interspersed videos in the class to let us know how this grammar is actually used, and it will also correct some of our easy-to-mispronunciation in real time, and it will also encourage us to speak well, so that we will not be afraid to speak Korean.",226,297,0,1,0.9986988306045532
630cf1c040e337e60fce1167,謝謝老師這學期細心且有耐心的教導，遇到有不會的地方老師都很願意提供協助，且具有一定成效，這學期我收益良多謝謝老師。只是希望課前暖身可以考量學生各自體力上的差距進行調整。,"Thank you teacher for your careful and patient teaching this semester. Teachers are willing to provide assistance in places where I don’t know how to do it, and it has achieved certain results. I have benefited a lot this semester. Thank you teacher. I just hope that the warm-up before class can be adjusted by considering the difference in physical strength of the students.",236,300,0,1,0.9998099207878113
630cf1c040e337e60fce1188,老師上課講解很仔細，但是作業常常一題就要交一次，希望可以一次交多題，然後減少繳交次數,"The teacher explains very carefully in class, but the homework often has to be handed in once for each question. I hope that I can hand in multiple questions at once, and then reduce the number of handovers",792,314,0,1,0.0036973953247070312
630cf1c040e337e60fce1125,有時候會來不及抄投影片同時聽課,Sometimes it is too late to copy the slides and listen to the class at the same time,369,298,0,1,0.0005366206169128418
630cf1c040e337e60fce10f5,老師很認真，但覺得作業有點太難⋯看發音跑code實在有點難，電腦不一定跑得出來，也不一定會操作。而且老師上課講話好快，筆記其實來不及抄完，建議修中韓再來修，但老師人很好很認真，有學到東西,"The teacher is very serious, but I think the homework is a bit too difficult. It is a bit difficult to read the pronunciation and run the code. The computer may not be able to run it, nor may it be able to operate it. Moreover, the teacher speaks very fast in class, and it is too late to finish copying the notes. It is recommended to study Chinese and Korean before studying, but the teacher is very nice and serious, and he has learned a lot",907,297,0,3,0.03518569469451904
630cf1c040e337e60fce119d,老師常常會詢問同學的學習狀況，上課講解的也很好。,"The teacher often asks about the students' learning status, and the explanations in class are also very good.",792,314,0,1,0.9998142123222351
630cf1c040e337e60fce118d,小考的數字都太醜了，每個都不整除、要取到小數點後三位數，明明是考驗會不會寫檢定，但實際上有超過一半的時間在按計算機,"The numbers in the quiz are too ugly, each one is not evenly divisible, and has to be rounded to three digits after the decimal point. It is obviously a test of whether you can write a test, but in fact, more than half of the time is pressed by the computer",792,314,0,1,0.00025457143783569336
630cf1c040e337e60fce116e,書維很讚！即便遠距教學也不會影響上課的效果，老師要保重身體QQ,"Shuwei is great! Even distance teaching will not affect the effect of class, teachers should take care of their health QQ",906,297,0,1,0.999487042427063
630cf1c040e337e60fce1155,非常注重在基本的姿勢動作，以及羽球的觀念建立，適合初學無觀念想要認真學習羽球的新手。,"It pays great attention to the basic posture and movement, as well as the concept of badminton. It is suitable for beginners who want to learn badminton seriously.",384,300,0,1,0.9994483590126038
630cf1c040e337e60fce1178,期中考出題範圍有些意料之外，雖然也屬於文法範疇，但是解釋平常上課也比較沒有注重的文法詞彙，好像對檢測學習效果沒有太大的幫助。,"The range of questions in the mid-term exam is a bit unexpected. Although it also belongs to the category of grammar, it does not seem to be of great help to test the learning effect.",906,297,0,1,0.013446509838104248
630cf1c040e337e60fce1103,老師貼近學生，能夠了解學生心中想法，並透過鼓勵的方式，讓學生建立自信心，也適時使用影片讓教學的內容更加生活且有趣，線上之後，教學上沒有太大的影響，仍然按照預定的課綱教學，也透過輪流的問答讓學生能夠練習口說，考試也因應線上有所調整。,"The teacher is close to the students, able to understand the thoughts of the students, and encourage the students to build up their self-confidence. They also use videos in a timely manner to make the teaching content more lively and interesting. After the online, there is not much impact on the teaching, and it is still in accordance with the scheduled The syllabus teaching also allows students to practice oral speaking through the question and answer in turn, and the exam is also adjusted in response to the online.",226,297,0,1,0.056181907653808594
630cf1c040e337e60fce11a2,老師上課很認真，會適時詢問同學是否了解，同時也會鼓勵我們自己思考,"The teacher is very serious in class, and will ask the students if they understand in due course, and at the same time encourage us to think for ourselves",792,314,0,1,0.9993396401405334
630cf1c040e337e60fce10ef,課程內容真的很豐富，在教完一個發音規則後，會出幾個句子讓我們試試，也會帶著我們一句一句慢慢念，並指出哪裡的發音需要做變化。,"The content of the course is really rich. After teaching a pronunciation rule, it will give us a few sentences for us to try. It will also lead us to read each sentence slowly, and point out where the pronunciation needs to be changed.",907,297,0,3,0.999569833278656
630cf1c040e337e60fce110c,謝謝老師～我很感激你的鼓勵讓我願意繼續堅持修習初韓下學期。,"Thank you teacher~ I am very grateful for your encouragement, which made me willing to continue to study for the next semester of Chuhan.",226,297,0,1,0.9997667670249939

630cf1c040e337e60fce10fa,老師最棒了，很喜歡上老師的課~發音規則、變化及語調都講解得很清楚，也很鼓勵學生開口練習並陪伴學生一步步念出正確的發音。上課的形式也很多元，我覺得用praat看發音很有趣，可以有一個專業的依據去發現自己的發音哪裡要改善。不過感覺最前面要跑praat跟r studio的母音分布圖老師可以再斟酌看看，因為感覺很多人跑不出來真的是跟電腦型號或是不是mac有關係，到後來都是老師幫我們跑圖，覺得老師這樣有點太辛苦了！,"The teacher is the best, I really like the teacher's class~ the pronunciation rules, changes and intonation are explained very clearly, and the students are encouraged to practice and accompany the students to read the correct pronunciation step by step. There are also many forms of class. I think it is very interesting to use praat to read pronunciation. It can have a professional basis to find out where my pronunciation needs to be improved. However, I feel that I have to run praat and the vowel distribution map of r studio at the beginning. Teacher can think about it again, because I feel that many people can’t run out. It really has something to do with the computer model or whether it is a Mac. Later, the teacher helped us run the map. , I think the teacher is a bit too hard!",907,297,0,3,0.05888330936431885
630cf1c040e337e60fce1117,老師上課非常認真且細心教學～但覺得有時候報告會偶爾佔用到上正課的時間導致進度有時上不完,The teacher is very serious and careful in teaching ~ but I feel that sometimes the report will occasionally take up the time of the main class and the progress sometimes cannot be completed,369,298,0,1,0.003268003463745117
630cf1c040e337e60fce111f,教室太壅擠及課桌椅較小 不方便做筆記,The classroom is too crowded and the desks and chairs are too small to take notes,369,298,0,1,0.00026994943618774414
630cf1c040e337e60fce11ae,一個學期好像不夠上完這堂課XD謝謝和老師、助教、同學們在這堂課的緣分，大概是大學裡我會記得很久的一堂課,"One semester seems not enough to finish this class XD Thank you for the fate with the teachers, teaching assistants, and classmates in this class. It is probably a class that I will remember for a long time in college",908,299,0,3,0.014065921306610107
630cf1c040e337e60fce114f,很喜歡老師偶爾會上新聞內容～而且也常是有趣好玩的新聞，上起來很快樂！ 第一次遇到老師願意一一糾正同學的日文發音，雖然常常被糾正很挫折...但覺得能學到真的日文發音收穫很大！（也希望考試不要緊張而狂念錯QQ）,"I really like that the teacher occasionally publishes news content ~ and it is often interesting and fun news, it is very happy to post it! This is the first time I have encountered a teacher who is willing to correct the Japanese pronunciation of my classmates one by one. Although it is often frustrating to be corrected...but I think it is very rewarding to learn the real Japanese pronunciation!

630cf1c040e337e60fce11af,這是一堂負擔蠻重但是會獲益良多的課，好像在這裡不論是任何形狀都可以被包容。前期的讀書討論可能會覺得有些枯燥跟累，但如果願意動腦和大家交流會有很多意外的收穫，也會激盪出新的想法！助教跟雁舒都很讚，辛苦了！,"This is a class with a heavy burden but a lot of benefits. It seems that no matter what shape it is here, it can be tolerated. The early reading and discussion may feel a bit boring and tiring, but if you are willing to use your brain to communicate with you, there will be a lot of unexpected gains, and new ideas will also be stimulated!

I really learned a lot after taking the grammar class for a year~ I feel that the teacher is very passionate about education, but it is impossible to meet everyone's needs in every way. I feel that the teacher has thoughtfully imagined a lot for us and has done a good job good enough! Hope the teacher won't feel bad for some different thoughts 🥲",906,297,0,1,0.9957004189491272

630cf1c040e337e60fce1174,老師很用心與認真的教學！不過有時講義的文法定義只有韓文或是只用中文解釋，希望可以統一～（不過韓文文法課本中也有詳細的中韓說明，這點是小問題） 另外，老師上課會講解可愛的現代韓文諧音用語，覺得很貼近生活很棒。 若是之後還有線上授課的需要，希望老師之後能嘗試使用非同步遠距，覺得非同步遠距真的比較能掌握好品質！,"The teacher is very attentive and serious in teaching! However, sometimes the grammatical definitions in the handouts are only in Korean or only explained in Chinese, I hope they can be unified~ (However, there are also detailed Chinese and Korean explanations in the Korean grammar textbook, this is a small problem) In addition, the teacher will explain the lovely modern Korean homophony in class It is great to think that it is very close to life.

630cf1c040e337e60fce11ce,上課看的紀錄片滿偏頗，提供的訊息太過片面化。以此做為議題討論的材料，會讓上課的討論缺乏足夠證據作為基礎，流於表淺，大家講的都是一些老調重彈的事或是價值正確的空泛論述（啊什麼都不知道的話就也只能講這些）。,"The documentaries I watched in class were full of bias, and the information provided was too one-sided. Using this as the material for topic discussion will make the discussion in class lack sufficient evidence as a basis and become superficial.

630cf1c040e337e60fce1175,老師人很好，非常親切、用心，只是有時候老師講義讓學生練習的例句會有點難，然後也希望老師可以再稍微放慢一點上課速度,"The teacher is very nice, very kind and caring, but sometimes it is a bit difficult for the teacher to let the students practice the example sentences in the lecture notes, and I hope the teacher can slow down the class a little bit",906,297,0,1,0.005830526351928711

630cf1c040e337e60fce11cf,建議文獻引用目錄的字數不計入期末書面報告字數,It is recommended that the number of words cited in the bibliography is not included in the word count of the final written report,912,715,0,3,0.006780028343200684
630cf1c140e337e60fce1203,謝謝Frau Chiang!非常認真負責且關心學生的老師!,Thank you Frau Chiang! Very serious and responsible teacher who cares about students!,910,312,0,3,0.9998205304145813
630cf1c040e337e60fce118c,超推薦老師的統計課，學到很多有用的知識，老師也很關心學生的學習狀況，很溫暖，能選到老師的統計課真是太好了，原本對統計只覺得很模糊很遙遠，在初統裡面，楊老師會用很簡單的方式讓大家了解統計是什麼、統計可以用在哪。統計真的是一門很有用的學問，包括後續的科目也與統計息息相關，最後的分析方法也可以應用在學科、實務方面。總的來說，如果這門課滿分是十分的話，我會給100分。,"I highly recommend the teacher's statistics class. I learned a lot of useful knowledge. The teacher also cares about the students' learning status and is very warm. It's great to be able to choose the teacher's statistics class. I only felt vague and far away about statistics at first. In the system, Teacher Yang will use a very simple way to let everyone understand what statistics are and where statistics can be used. Statistics is really a very useful subject, and the subsequent subjects are also closely related to statistics. The final analysis method can also be applied to disciplines and practice. Overall, I would give this course a 100 out of 10.",792,314,0,1,0.9992425441741943
630cf1c040e337e60fce10f6,真的很喜歡上老師的課！老師教的很仔細，也解答了我很多之前發音的疑惑～看到書維開的課選下去就對ㄌ,"Really enjoyed my teacher's class! The teacher taught very carefully, and also answered many of my previous doubts about pronunciation~ I saw Shuwei’s class and chose it rightㄌ",907,297,0,3,0.9998387098312378

630cf1c040e337e60fce116c,老師非常認真，常常會鼓勵我們～也能很清楚的指導！不過有時候上課會不小心講太多道理導致練習時間有點不夠,"The teacher is very serious and often encourages us ~ and can also guide us clearly! However, sometimes in class, I will accidentally talk too much about the truth, so that the practice time is not enough",236,300,0,1,0.4143831133842468
630cf1c040e337e60fce1124,教授上課使用深入淺出的方式教學，使學生了解國際關係的理論，並設計模聯活動實際體驗國際互動，也請外面專業講師進行演講，課程內容豐富多元，為值得修習的一堂好課,"The professor uses a simple and simple way to teach in class, so that students can understand the theory of international relations, and design MUN activities to experience international interaction. They also invite outside professional lecturers to give speeches. The course content is rich and diverse, and it is a good class worth learning",369,298,0,1,0.9998237490653992
630cf1c040e337e60fce110e,教學速度剛好，可以很好的跟上，老師會抽人回答問題，讓教學有互動，也讓人更專心,"The teaching speed is just right, and you can keep up with it very well. The teacher will draw people to answer questions, so that the teaching is interactive and makes people more attentive",226,297,0,1,0.9998742341995239
630cf1c040e337e60fce11a3,老師教的統計學真的是我在政大收穫最多的一門課，真的推薦到不能再推薦更多了！也真的很謝謝老師期中的咖啡禮物，讓我有更多動力讀統計學，下課時老師還會來我們的座位一一問我們有沒有問題，也會依照我們的想法做調整，真的超級無敵感動的！老師這麼認真都害我不敢不認真念統計，也讓我決定輔統計系學更多更有趣實用的統計學，謝謝老師～～～～～,"The statistics taught by the teacher is really the course that I have learned the most in National Chengchi University, and I really recommend it so much that I can’t recommend more! I am also really grateful to the teacher for the mid-term coffee gift, which gave me more motivation to study statistics. After class, the teacher would come to our seats one by one to ask us if we had any questions, and make adjustments according to our ideas. It is really super Invincible moving! The teacher is so serious that I dare not study statistics seriously, and it also made me decide to study more interesting and practical statistics in the Department of Statistics. Thank you teacher~~~~~",792,314,0,1,0.999664306640625
630cf1c040e337e60fce1152,有明確說明課程規劃的方向、快速點出同學自身的問題與不足之處,"Clearly explain the direction of course planning, and quickly point out students' own problems and deficiencies",384,300,0,1,0.6769842505455017
630cf1c040e337e60fce11b1,扣掉格式與寫作外，我真正的史導課大概是在這邊學的。,"Except for the format and writing, I probably learned my real history tutorial here.",913,308,0,2,0.033037006855010986
630cf1c040e337e60fce10f0,在課本還沒到之前希望老師可以提早上傳講義，也希望老師可以盡快提供期中考成績，讓我們可以評估期末有沒有其他補救的空間,"Before the textbook arrives, I hope the teacher can upload the handouts in advance, and I also hope that the teacher can provide the midterm exam results as soon as possible, so that we can evaluate whether there is any room for other remedies at the end of the semester",907,297,0,3,0.009424448013305664
630cf1c040e337e60fce119c,注重觀念，當學到新的觀念時，也會再次複習相關的已學知識，作業不會太多，都是該章節重點，考試也是，各方面都很好，謝謝老師這一年來的教導。,"Pay attention to concepts. When you learn new concepts, you will review the relevant knowledge you have learned. There will not be too many homework, which are the key points of this chapter, and the exam is also good. Thank you for your teaching this year.",792,314,0,1,0.9998494386672974
630cf1c140e337e60fce1202,謝謝老師,"Thank you, teacher",910,312,0,3,0.999835729598999

630cf1c040e337e60fce110d,老師上課節奏有點太快了qq 筆記來不及抄完、來不及思考⋯但老師真的很認真很棒！分組練習可以幫助學習，考試也不會太難，超推書維老師，學到很多！！！ 只是遠距一直點人其實壓力有點大，一堂課平均會被叫到3-4次🥲🥲,"The pace of the teacher's class is a bit too fast, and the qq notes are too late to copy and think... But the teacher is really serious and great! Practice in groups can help you study, and the exam will not be too difficult. Super push Mr. Shuwei, you can learn a lot! ! ! It’s just that it’s a bit stressful to keep pointing people from a distance. On average, one class will be called 3-4 times🥲🥲",226,297,0,1,0.9991255402565002
630cf1c040e337e60fce1195,希望考試時的數字可以出的比較容易計算，小考時經常花大部費時間在計算困難的數字，我認為考試應該是測驗學生是否對課程內容了解，而非考驗學生的計算能力。 楊老師的教學淺顯易懂，也時常在上課時講授一些道理，這一年來學生獲益良多，也學到了除了統計已外的觀念，謝謝老師。,"I hope that the numbers in the exam can be calculated more easily. During the quiz, most of the time is often spent on calculating difficult numbers. I think the exam should test whether students understand the course content, rather than test students' calculation ability. Teacher Yang's teaching is easy to understand, and he often explains some principles in class. This year, students have benefited a lot and learned concepts other than statistics. Thank you teacher.",792,314,0,1,0.9888585805892944
630cf1c140e337e60fce1232,老師上課真的非常用心，幫我們整理筆記、淺顯易懂的案例去講解複雜的條文，把課本很多很雜的內容濃縮之後交給我們，重點也會一直重複提醒，讓我們不會忘記 平時上課也會跟我們聊聊時事，讓課堂不會這麼無聊 真的很謝謝老師～很喜歡老師的商事法課！,"The teacher is really attentive in class, helping us organize notes, explaining complex provisions with simple and easy-to-understand cases, condensing a lot of complicated content in the textbook and handing it over to us. The key points will always be reminded repeatedly, so that we will not forget the usual class I will also chat with us about current affairs, so that the class will not be so boring. I really thank the teacher~ I like the business law class of the teacher very much!",57,326,0,1,0.9996073842048645
630cf1c140e337e60fce127d,老師上課很認真，活動也很有趣,The teacher is very serious in class and the activities are very interesting,898,322,3,3,0.999854326248169
630cf1c140e337e60fce1356,因為這堂課並非英文授課，想詢問是否能在出考卷時考慮同學的英文程度,"Because this class is not taught in English, I would like to ask if it is possible to consider the English proficiency of the students when issuing the test papers",421,329,0,3,0.027391552925109863
630cf1c140e337e60fce1247,希望老師能更好的調配課程進度，才不會導致期末的課程太倉促。,"I hope that the teacher can better arrange the progress of the course, so that the course at the end of the semester will not be too hasty.",910,312,0,3,0.09421968460083008
630cf1c140e337e60fce123a,老師讓產生對商事法很大的興趣，雖然老師說可自由選擇是否到課，但我自第一堂課起Ｍ沒有一堂是缺席的，每次都很期待上課，老師講課內容精采生動，老沈麵食店、董事會、各種情境，都讓我更了解商事法的內容，然而遠距後，學習效果下降非常多，相當可惜，希望疫情能趕緊過去。,"The teacher made me very interested in commercial law. Although the teacher said that I can freely choose whether to attend the class, I have never been absent from the first class. I look forward to the class every time. Shen's noodle shop, the board of directors, and various situations have made me understand the content of commercial law better. However, after a long distance, the learning effect has dropped a lot. It is a pity. I hope the epidemic can pass quickly.",57,326,0,1,0.003576815128326416
630cf1c140e337e60fce135c,謝謝老師！老師辛苦了！,"Thank you, teacher! The teacher has worked hard!",197,335,0,1,0.999835729598999
630cf1c140e337e60fce1366,希望老師能把期末考時間再拉長一點，像期中考那樣考三個小時，這樣才不會變成是在考學生的計算速度而非觀念，不過老師真的教得非常棒！,"I hope the teacher can extend the time for the final exam a little longer, like the midterm exam for three hours, so that it will not become a test of the students' calculation speed instead of concepts, but the teacher is really good at teaching!",197,335,0,1,0.9976149797439575

630cf1c140e337e60fce1233,老師講的清楚明瞭，很喜歡，增加我對法律的興趣,"The teacher speaks clearly and clearly, I like it very much, it increases my interest in law",57,326,0,1,0.9997100234031677

630cf1c140e337e60fce1240,老師教得很好! 沈老師上課完全不會讓學生感到有壓力，是非常輕鬆的一門課! 甚至有點像是通識 上課整理的筆記也很簡單明瞭，也會舉很多例子來解釋法條，是很棒的一門課程!,"The teacher teaches very well! Teacher Shen does not make students feel pressured in the class, it is a very relaxing class! Even the notes organized in a general education class are very simple and clear, and will give many examples to explain the law, It's a great course!",57,326,0,1,0.999729573726654

630cf1c140e337e60fce1355,老師教課感覺有些隨意，雖然先前就有說會有很多excel，但老師真的沒有教得很清楚，每一週的個案都要花很多時間去自學。如果是希望從這樣課得到很紮實的供應鏈管理基礎，我不推薦...因為準備考試的時候更像是知道怎麼修改excel的資料而已。作為基礎課程，或許可以再加強關於概念理論過程之類的內容。,"The teacher's teaching feels a little casual. Although it was said that there will be a lot of excel, the teacher really didn't teach it very clearly. Every week, a lot of time is spent on self-study. If you want to get a solid supply chain management foundation from this class, I don't recommend it...because preparing for the exam is more like knowing how to modify excel data. As a basic course, it may be possible to strengthen the content about the process of concept theory.",421,329,0,3,0.021379590034484863
630cf1c140e337e60fce1228,真的非常喜歡老師的課！很喜歡老師的口音，上課講述非常有條理、口條清晰，除了課程內容之外還會引進一些實際上社會生活中的例子在課堂上跟我們討論。很可惜沒辦法修到老師下學期的選修課，這堂個體經濟學真的是在政大數一數二喜歡的課！,"I really like the teacher's class! I like the teacher's accent very much. The class lectures are very organized and clear. In addition to the course content, some examples from actual social life will be introduced to discuss with us in class. It's a pity that I can't take the elective course that the teacher will take next semester. This individual economics is really one of the favorite courses in Zhengda University!",239,313,3,1,0.9989953637123108
630cf1c140e337e60fce1248,是一堂非常棒的課，讓我從此愛上德文,It was a great class and made me fall in love with German ever since,910,312,0,3,0.9996966123580933
630cf1c140e337e60fce1236,這學期非常喜歡上老師的課，很感動老師不只是教書，也在社會重大事件發生時給予我們鼓勵和人生建議，真的非常感謝。建議部分，希望老師遠距可以使用平板(e.g. ipad)手寫的方式呈現版書，實體課的時候覺得老師的板書很有脈絡也很易懂，遠距授課改由文字講義編排，就覺得比較缺乏系統化，易讀性也不高，但整體瑕不掩瑜，遠距期間還是非常喜歡聽老師的課,"I really like the teacher's class this semester. I am very moved that the teacher not only teaches, but also gives us encouragement and life advice when major social events happen. I am really grateful. For the suggestion part, I hope that the teacher can use tablet (e.g. ipad) handwriting to present the version of the book from a distance. During the physical class, I feel that the teacher’s blackboard writing is very contextual and easy to understand. I feel that it is lacking when the distance teaching is changed to text handouts. It is systematic and the readability is not high, but the overall flaws are not concealed. I still like to listen to the teacher's class during the long-distance period.",57,326,0,1,0.9917600750923157
630cf1c140e337e60fce123b,老師口條很好,The teacher speaks very well,57,326,0,1,0.9998588562011719

630cf1c140e337e60fce124f,世琳老師是一位非常認真且用心的老師，對於學生提出之問題也不吝於回答。 不過對於學習語言來說這個上課教室時再不太方便於對話交流，希望未來能考慮會議間較適合的教室。,"Teacher Shi Lin is a very serious and caring teacher, and she is not shy about answering students' questions. However, for language learning, this classroom is not very convenient for dialogue and communication. I hope that in the future, I can consider a more suitable classroom for conferences.",910,312,0,3,0.9316973686218262

630cf1c140e337e60fce124a,看得出來老師對教學很有熱誠，但常常對學生的問題答非所問，提出不相干的論證想讓學生接受自己的邏輯，希望老師能廣納學生的建議彈性調整課程規劃。,"It can be seen that the teacher is very enthusiastic about teaching, but often answers the students' questions irrelevantly, and puts forward irrelevant arguments to make the students accept their own logic. I hope that the teacher can accommodate the students' suggestions and adjust the course planning flexibly.",910,312,0,3,0.9952148199081421
630cf1c140e337e60fce123c,老師把困難艱澀的法律條文用很清晰明瞭的邏輯架構教給學生，非常有幸在政大上到好老師的課,The teacher taught the difficult and difficult legal provisions to the students with a very clear and clear logical structure. I am very fortunate to have a good teacher in Zhengda University,57,326,0,1,0.9996751546859741
630cf1c140e337e60fce1241,這堂課老師超級認真，老師本人也非常親切，都會時不時給予大家鼓勵，每次上課缺席的人也不多，上課氛圍佳，很喜歡!!!!!,"The teacher in this class is super serious, and the teacher himself is also very kind. He will encourage everyone from time to time. There are not many people who are absent from class every time.

630cf1c140e337e60fce12a6,老師上課的速度很剛好，會在幫同學複習各種格位的變化，考試內容也不會出太難，針對學習重點出這一點我覺得很好，謝謝老師！,"The speed of the teacher's class is just right, and he will help the students to review the changes of various positions, and the content of the exam will not be too difficult. I think it is very good to focus on the learning points, thank you teacher!",442,355,0,3,0.9998096823692322
630cf1c140e337e60fce135a,我真心建議老師可以在課程先修放在excel 因為很多function 並不是大家都會 老師上課投影的畫面又很小 非常難參照 並且老師其實講的很亂 我私下問很多同學大家其實都聽不懂抓不到重點 考試都是自己讀 每週個案作業也是要花很多時間自己理解 並且我認為一個組五六個人有點太多了一定會有free rider 三到四人比較合適 大家討論也更有效率  另外 班上有收外籍生所以老師時不時會切換成英文 可是老實說老師的英文也不是特別好 其他同學更可能是完全沒在聽那部分 那為什麼要收,"I sincerely suggest that the teacher can put it in excel before the course, because many functions are not understood by everyone. The screen projected by the teacher in class is very small and very difficult to refer to, and the teacher’s speech is actually very messy. I asked many students in private, and everyone actually couldn’t understand. It takes a lot of time to understand the weekly casework until the key exams, and I think there are too many people in a group of five or six. There must be a free rider. Three to four people are more suitable for everyone to discuss and be more efficient. In addition, in the class Some foreign students are accepted, so the teacher will switch to English from time to time, but to be honest, the teacher’s English is not very good. Other students may not be listening to that part at all, so why do they accept it?",421,329,0,3,0.0006638169288635254
630cf1c140e337e60fce1229,老師常常帶著我們用經濟思考人生問題或時事，覺得很有趣! 自己從來沒想那麼多。,"The teacher often leads us to think about life problems or current events in terms of economics, which is very interesting! I never think so much.",239,313,3,1,0.998740017414093
630cf1c140e337e60fce1369,整體上課節奏很適當，唯一小建議是，遠距上課的筆記抄好快，會跟不上老師的速度,"The overall class rhythm is very appropriate. The only small suggestion is that if you copy the notes in the remote class quickly, you will not be able to keep up with the teacher's speed.",197,335,0,1,0.012247443199157715
630cf1c140e337e60fce1243,老師很認真 但希望老師的給分透明度可以高一點,"The teacher is very serious, but I hope the transparency of the teacher's grading can be higher",910,312,0,3,0.9859697818756104
630cf1c140e337e60fce1361,老師教學認真，講義內容豐富，讓我獲益良多。,"The teacher is serious in teaching and the lecture notes are rich in content, which has benefited me a lot.",197,335,0,1,0.9998400211334229

630cf1c140e337e60fce1245,老師真的真的非常認真負責！可以從教學中感受到老師很希望幫助同學能快速了解德文的心意，有點可惜的是本學期後半段改為遠距，學習效果相較於實體課程還是有些減損！但老師為了幫助同學能夠跟上進度著實費了不少心思，包含每周的課後叮嚀以及小作文的批改，在在都顯示出老師的用心，非常感謝老師這學期的教導：）,"The teacher is really very serious and responsible! It can be felt from the teaching that the teacher really hopes to help students quickly understand German. It is a pity that the second half of this semester has been changed to distance learning, and the learning effect is still somewhat reduced compared to the physical course! But the teacher has spent a lot of thought to help the students keep up with the progress, including the weekly reminders after class and the correction of small essays, all of which show the teacher's hard work. Thank you very much for the teacher's teaching this semester:)",910,312,0,3,0.9976327419281006
630cf1c140e337e60fce135d,對我來說不是一門好拿分的課，因為考試並不簡單，但老師上課是真的很認真，也感受得到老師的教學熱忱。老師上課是邊上課邊抄筆記，節奏偏快，如果稍微慢一點可能會比較好吸收內容。,"It is not an easy class for me to get points, because the exam is not easy, but the teacher is really serious in class, and I can feel the teacher's enthusiasm for teaching. The teacher is taking notes while attending class, and the pace is too fast. If it is a little slower, it may be better to absorb the content.",197,335,0,1,0.9654818177223206
630cf1c140e337e60fce124e,老師教學非常用心，也時常鼓勵同學，沒有老師只有課本的話就無法有效學習， 而且老師也滿幽默的（？）總之很推薦老師的德文課！,"The teacher is very attentive in teaching and often encourages the students. Without the teacher and only the textbooks, it is impossible to learn effectively, and the teacher is also full of humor (?) In short, I highly recommend the teacher's German class!",910,312,0,3,0.9993239641189575
630cf1c140e337e60fce123e,期中報告到期末了還不知道要幹嘛有點讓人焦慮⋯但老師很讚也很關心學生～希望遠距的時候可以錄影讓學生之後重看上課內容,"The mid-term report is due and I don’t know what to do. It’s a bit anxious...but the teacher is very good and cares about the students~ I hope that when I am far away, I can record the video so that the students can review the class content later",57,326,0,1,0.9996194839477539
630cf1c140e337e60fce12a5,老師講解語法清楚明瞭，上課時也補充很多有趣內容。,"The teacher explained the grammar clearly, and added a lot of interesting content during the class.",442,355,0,3,0.9996219873428345
630cf1c140e337e60fce124b,老師很用心!課程雖然有點累但很紮實~,"The teacher is very attentive! Although the course is a bit tiring, it is very solid~",910,312,0,3,0.9998247027397156
630cf1c140e337e60fce1244,Frau 江的德文教學能夠幫助打好基礎，對於以後更進階的語文學習提供幫助。小缺點是週五常常會遇到各式各樣的放假，以及期末總是提早一堂，希望老師更完善的規劃課程的進度，避免讓同學將所有課程進度都擠在一起難以準備。,"Frau Jiang's German teaching can help lay a solid foundation and provide help for more advanced language learning in the future. The small disadvantage is that there are often various holidays on Fridays, and the final class is always early. I hope that the teacher can better plan the progress of the course, so as to avoid making it difficult for students to squeeze all the course progress together.",910,312,0,3,0.008932650089263916
630cf1c140e337e60fce124d,非常感謝Frau 江帶來這麼棒的課。只是美中不足的是每次上課的負擔不太一樣，導致學習的時間規劃容易被打亂。,"Many thanks to Frau Jiang for such a great class. The only fly in the ointment is that the burden of each class is not the same, which leads to easy disruption of the study time plan.",910,312,0,3,0.003485381603240967
630cf1c140e337e60fce1235,希望老師可以避免偏離主題，例如過度強調法律與商學之間的關係.....謝謝!!,"I hope the teacher can avoid going off topic, such as overemphasizing the relationship between law and business.....Thank you!!",57,326,0,1,0.9972274899482727

630cf1c140e337e60fce135f,希望老師上課時可以放慢速度讓我們有更多消化 吸收知識的時間,I hope the teacher can slow down in class so that we have more time to digest and absorb knowledge,197,335,0,1,0.0011673569679260254
630cf1c140e337e60fce124c,老師有很多堅持的地方，而且重複提醒的次數有點多，常常會拖到下課時間，雖然老師說教學進度他來負責，但課程來不及的時候承諾好的補救措施也沒有順利的給我們讓我們有點手足無措。 遠距考試的方式極其繁瑣，已經在讓人焦慮的時候更讓人焦慮，如果有人很喜歡下載監考軟體和開著鏡頭不能模糊背景的話可能很適合你。 適合完全沒學過想紮實學習文法的同學，整體來說老師很用心，但是作業和課後事項有點多而且有時候會突然改變要注意能不能負擔。,"The teacher has a lot of insistence, and the number of repeated reminders is a bit too much, and it is often delayed until the end of class time. Although the teacher said that he is responsible for the teaching progress, the promised remedial measures did not go smoothly when the course was too late. At a loss. The remote test method is extremely cumbersome, and it makes people more anxious when it is already making people anxious. If someone likes to download proctor software and open the camera without blurring the background, it may be suitable for you. It is suitable for students who have never studied grammar at all and want to study grammar solidly. Overall, the teacher is very attentive, but there are a lot of homework and after-school things, and sometimes there will be sudden changes, so pay attention to whether you can afford it.",910,312,0,3,0.0012362003326416016

630cf1c140e337e60fce1364,老師跟助教都很認真盡責，只是有時候教學速度太快難以吸收，遠距以前沒有複習影片有點困擾，遠距後有錄影片可以課後複習好多了，最後希望老師身體快點恢復健康~,"The teacher and teaching assistants are very conscientious and responsible, but sometimes the teaching speed is too fast and difficult to absorb. It is a bit troublesome that there is no review video before the distance. After the distance, there is a video to review after class. It is much better. Finally, I hope the teacher will recover quickly~",197,335,0,1,0.0326845645904541
630cf1c140e337e60fce127b,超喜歡這學期ETP去看展覽和snack fair的活動，收穫滿滿,"I really like ETP this semester to go to the exhibition and snack fair activities, and I have gained a lot",898,322,3,3,0.9985862970352173

630cf1c240e337e60fce14a3,希望老師上課時能給多一點課內的相關資料，純講述或僅對照課本，對於當下或課後複習效果不太好。,I hope that the teacher can give more relevant materials in the class during the class. It is not very effective for the current or after-class review.,841,359,0,1,0.0002263188362121582
630cf1c140e337e60fce13eb,湛老師教學相當認真，課程內容也非常扎實，但也相對的較為困難一些，儘管是英文授課，但仍希望老師可以多用中文解釋一些比較困難的圖形跟概念。另外，模擬投資競賽很有趣，也讓人可以嘗試用大部位的資金去購買那些風險較高的公司，但缺點是stocktrak無法適時反應市場的價格，無法進行日內沖銷，對於隔日沖的操作也不是很友善，如果有更好的模擬投資平台，建議老師可以換一個試試看。,"Teacher Zhan is very serious in teaching, and the course content is also very solid, but it is relatively difficult. Although the class is taught in English, I still hope that the teacher can explain some difficult graphics and concepts in Chinese. In addition, the simulated investment competition is very interesting, and it also allows people to try to use a large part of the funds to buy those companies with higher risks, but the disadvantage is that stocktrak cannot reflect the market price in a timely manner, and cannot perform intra-day write-offs, and it is not suitable for the operation of the next-day rush Very friendly, if there is a better simulated investment platform, I suggest that the teacher can try another one.",286,341,3,1,0.004157721996307373

I was reading aloud completely according to the textbook. Is it a robot or a storyteller? If the teacher just keeps reading the words in the books, then there is really no need to come back to teach after retirement. It doesn’t matter if you can rest at home! I can hardly write any notes in class, and the teacher still feels that his teaching quality is good. I don’t know the great achievements of the teacher when he was young, but I can only say that this semester is the most worthless I have ever attended. class! The scores haven’t come out yet, so it’s hard for me to say whether this course is sweet or not. It’s very cool, but the courses in the department are basically not very good at roll call.

630cf1c140e337e60fce12bb,老師非常有教學熱誠，也很樂意回應學生的需求。老師的授課內容也很貼近生活，學習的過程不會有太大的負擔。另外，課程中的口說練習時間非常充足，每次上完三個小時的課都感覺到自己的聽說讀寫能力都進步了。,"The teachers are very passionate about teaching and are willing to respond to the needs of the students. The teacher's teaching content is also very close to life, and the learning process will not have too much burden. In addition, there is plenty of time for oral practice in the course.

630cf1c240e337e60fce147c,老師教得很好，但有時會過於重複同樣的東西，導致進度有些緩慢，有點可惜QQ,"The teacher teaches very well, but sometimes he repeats the same things too much, which leads to a slow progress, which is a pity QQ",920,352,0,1,0.00041049718856811523
630cf1c240e337e60fce1475,感覺常常會講重複的東西，希望老師在課程安排精簡一些，但瑕不掩瑜，是個好老師,"I feel that I often talk about repetitive things. I hope that the teacher will simplify the curriculum, but the flaws are not hidden. He is a good teacher",920,352,0,1,0.999377965927124

630cf1c140e337e60fce1292,老師很鼓勵學生問問題，但通常參與度不是很高，身為外系的學生修課起來不會到非常困難（只是哲學的先備知識最好要有一些）,"Teachers encourage students to ask questions, but usually the level of participation is not very high.

The exam will not be too difficult, as long as there are classes and questions to write, you can write it. I hope the teacher can teach more content. The progress of the class seems to be a bit slow.

630cf1c140e337e60fce12b9,老師上課非常認真，也很關心同學們的學習狀況。希望可以更斟酌某些內容的複習頻率，例如一些不是太複雜的對話有時連續好幾週不斷出現，會讓人有點不知所措。,"The teacher is very serious in class and cares about the students' learning situation. I hope that the review frequency of certain content can be considered more carefully.

In the first class of the class, we will chat with us and explain the syllabus of the course, and then we will start to play the game after a few practice passing and catching the ball and attacking the defense!

630cf1c140e337e60fce13cf,遠距後改成個人鬼故事影片，每次作業的繳交都會有一次的分數，準備起來反而比原本的團體期末發表分量還多，評分標準也相對模糊、難掌握(需要花比較多心力)，但也是因為疫情所致，無可奈何。 另外，很喜歡老師播放的深夜食堂影片><每一個故事都很溫馨，片尾的料理教學也很可愛,"After a long distance, I changed it to a personal ghost story film. Every time I hand in the homework, there will be a score. The preparation is more important than the original group final presentation. The scoring standards are relatively vague and difficult to grasp (requires more effort) , but also because of the epidemic, there is nothing to do.

630cf1c240e337e60fce1492,因為這門課又慢慢愛上運動而且越來越知道該怎麼運動，課前老師都會帶大家暖身，課後也會有足夠的放鬆時間，每週都是非常充實而且完整的兩小時課程。,"Because this class has gradually fallen in love with sports and knows how to do sports more and more, the teacher will warm up everyone before class, and there will be enough relaxation time after class.

630cf1c240e337e60fce143d,建議縮短討論時間，討論時間一節課有點太長了。老師在與同學討論方案時、或點同學回答問題時，建議可以紀錄下來，這樣能看出哪幾組比較不常發言、常發言可以加課堂分數，討論方案也能更有效率。作業和討論的份量很剛好，讓人能學到東西也不會覺得有壓力~老師人很好！,"It is suggested to shorten the discussion time, which is a bit too long for one class. When the teacher discusses the plan with the students, or when the students answer the questions, it is suggested to record it, so that it can be seen which groups do not speak frequently, and the class points can be added to the frequent speech, and the discussion plan can be more efficient.

630cf1c140e337e60fce126a,這堂課的老師非常可愛，上課內容也很清楚，而且老師繳交作業的期限也相對彈性，修這堂課的時候不會有很大的壓力，反而會覺得可以很輕鬆地學英文，上台報告的時間也不會很長，可以借此機會增進口說能力，這學期的課寫作方面比較多，老師也會針對自己寫的essay給予很多建議，整體來說很棒。,"The teacher in this class is very cute, the content of the class is also very clear, and the deadline for the teacher to hand in homework is relatively flexible. There will not be a lot of pressure when taking this class, but you will feel that you can learn English very easily and go on stage The report time will not be very long, and I can take this opportunity to improve my speaking ability.

630cf1c140e337e60fce132f,上課很好玩，不會因為田徑就很無聊，適合不喜歡球類運動的學生，大太陽時老師也都會體諒我們讓我們早點下課，唯一要注意的是跳遠可能鞋子會進沙比較不舒服。老師人真的很好，成績也不會用測驗來評定，單純看出缺席，參加校慶運動會則另外加分，這次很可惜因為疫情自己無法參加這門課組的大隊接力，非常推薦大家來選修這門課，老師也會設計一些小遊戲或競賽，也因為人數不多，老師常常會個別幫我們看動作。整體而言真的推。但改遠距後就真的比較無聊一點點了，但這也是沒辦法的事，希望這次的疫情真的是最後一波了。,"The class is very fun, and it won’t be boring because of track and field. It is suitable for students who don’t like ball games. The teacher will understand us and ask us to finish class early when the sun is high. The only thing to pay attention to is that sand may get into the sand in the long jump and it will be uncomfortable. The teachers are really nice, and the grades will not be judged by the test. If you simply see the absence, you will get extra points for participating in the school celebration sports meeting. It is a pity that I cannot participate in the team relay of this course because of the epidemic. I highly recommend everyone to take it as an elective In this class, the teacher will also design some small games or competitions, and because there are not many students, the teacher often helps us watch the movements individually. Overall really pushed. But after changing the distance, it is really a little bit boring, but there is no way to do it. I hope this epidemic is really the last wave.",429,336,0,1,0.11380326747894287

630cf1c140e337e60fce131f,老師人很好，只是考試內容實在偏多，有時候上課也比較艱深，內容多又不簡單，要花不少時間讀，希望老師上課可以多帶題目，不然考試時不知道如何下手，跟助教課的方法有時候又有出入,"The teacher is very nice, but the exam content is too much, and sometimes the class is difficult, the content is too much and not easy, it takes a lot of time to read, I hope the teacher can bring more questions in class, otherwise I don’t know how to start the exam, I will talk to the teaching assistant Sometimes the method of class is different",112,333,0,1,0.0022886991500854492
630cf1c140e337e60fce13b0,非常扎實的日文課!老師的文法很強，可以學到很多，尤其很喜歡老師會幫助學生整理、比較相似、易搞混的文型。不過覺得期中考算分太重，多選題錯一個選項就全扣分，填充題自己造的句子也是可能少寫一個助詞整題分數就沒了，希望這部分可以改善!(學測、指考的多選題也不會錯一題就全扣分呀)，除了這點其他部分真的都很棒!!,"Very solid Japanese class! The teacher's grammar is very strong, and I can learn a lot. I especially like that the teacher will help students sort out and compare similar and confusing writing styles. However, I feel that the mid-term exam is too heavy. If you make a wrong choice in multiple-choice questions, all points will be deducted. If you make a sentence for the filling question, you may write one particle less and the whole question score will be gone. I hope this part can be improved! (Study test, guide The multiple-choice questions in the test will not deduct all points if you make a wrong question), except for this point, the other parts are really great!!",146,331,2,3,0.9788594245910645
630cf1c140e337e60fce13d8,覺得這堂課對於沒有實習或工作經驗、先前沒有修過供應鏈管理的學生來說，要在課堂中快速學到很多東西＋報告寫得很好，困難度稍高。 老師的授課方式以提供相關主題的實際業界case為主，會用發問的方式帶領大家思考，這樣很好也很喜歡， 但課本上的概念就講比較少，對於大學部學生來說負擔蠻大的，需要花更多時間自修，再加上作業多，一週花在這堂課的時間也因此很多 而學期中有些作業難度較高，如果整組同學都是大學部的，要有心理準備... 整體來說這堂課很棒，但要有需要花很多時間的心理準備,"I feel that this course is a little more difficult for students who have no internship or work experience and have not taken supply chain management before. They have to learn a lot in class + write a good report. The teacher's teaching method is mainly to provide practical industry cases of relevant topics, and will lead everyone to think by asking questions. This is very good and I like it very much, but the concepts in the textbook are relatively few, which is quite a burden for undergraduate students Yes, you need to spend more time on self-study, plus there are a lot of homework, so you spend a lot of time in this class a week, and some homework in the semester is more difficult. If the whole group of students are from the university department, you must be mentally prepared. .. Overall the class was great but be prepared to spend a lot of time",926,329,0,3,0.2273167371749878
630cf1c240e337e60fce14f8,在這門課程中，老師很用心邀請許多講者，來分享與「貧窮」和「永續」相關的議題。課程設計上，透過閱讀書籍、聽講座、看電影，以及每次的討論環節，讓我們對貧窮議題有更深的認識。此外，也有半學期的時間進行專案實作，讓我們實際發想一個解決貧窮的專案，課程相當充實。,"In this course, the teacher carefully invited many speakers to share issues related to ""poverty"" and ""sustainability"".

Many students have unstable connections when they are far away. It may be a problem with the teacher's network, but the application does not have a chat room function and cannot respond in a timely manner.

630cf1c140e337e60fce1357,謝謝老師這學期的教導，但希望重要理論與計算的解說能夠更詳細，也可以在課堂上演練多一點題目。作業份量也建議稍作調整。,"Thank you teacher for your teaching this semester, but I hope that the explanation of important theories and calculations can be more detailed, and more topics can be practiced in class.

630cf1c140e337e60fce1360,老師教得很好，雖然上課速度有點快，很容易就跟不上，但聽完老師的課都會覺得收穫很多，老師辛苦了,"The teacher teaches very well.

630cf1c140e337e60fce130a,老師尊重學生，又提醒學生尊重自己的意願，讓我不會感到壓力，覺得很好。接觸到的學理與建議感覺會終生受益，希望自己能持續在生活中落實。透過電影來提供心理經驗，再讓學生進行分析，我覺得這樣的模式很不錯。除了能增添課程趣味性之外，其中許多電影我都不是第一次看了，但是透過這樣的方式，讓我能夠更深入了解片中人物的心理，獲得更深入的觀影體驗。也因為電影常常是很貼近生活的，因此讓我在把這套分析搬到現實生活裡時，不會覺得很困難。是頗有收獲的一堂課！,"The teacher respects the students and reminds the students to respect their own wishes, so I don't feel pressured and feel very good. I feel that the theories and suggestions I have come into contact with will benefit me throughout my life, and I hope I can continue to implement them in my life. I think it is a good model to provide psychological experience through movies and let students analyze it. In addition to adding to the fun of the course, it is not the first time I have watched many of these films, but through this method, I can gain a deeper understanding of the psychology of the characters in the films and gain a more in-depth viewing experience. It is also because movies are often very close to life, so I will not find it difficult to apply this analysis to real life. It was a rewarding class!",917,332,0,3,0.999636173248291
630cf1c140e337e60fce12f2,老師的授課很有深度且同學提問樂於回答，但是有時候會講太快（不過內容很多想趕快教完是可以理解的！）認為考試前的題目分析可以再清楚一點！！有時候只會講到大概> <,"The teacher's lectures are very in-depth and the students are willing to answer questions, but sometimes they speak too quickly (but it's understandable to want to finish teaching as soon as possible!)

630cf1c140e337e60fce13de,很喜歡這堂課的節奏！老師也講的很詳細卻不會過於枯燥，不過大家的日本語因為不適合自學，所以很難在課程結束後再自己往下學，可能未來可以考慮換個比較能自學的教材～但整體來說很喜歡這堂課！,"Love the pace of this class! The teacher is also very detailed but not too boring. However, because everyone's Japanese is not suitable for self-study, it is difficult to continue to study after the course is over.

630cf1c240e337e60fce14ea,上這堂課前其實並不瞭解木球是甚麼，但在老師的用心教導下(雖然很可惜因為天候不佳、疫情遠距等因素少掉很多實際揮桿練習的機會...尤其是本來安排在學期最後幾周的團體賽QQ)不僅更認識了木球這項運動，也對自己的體育技能(?)更加有信心! 老師教導每一個動作時都十分清楚、詳細，能令學生有效率地練習、驗收，是門輕鬆優質的體育課~,"Before taking this class, I didn’t know what a wooden ball is, but under the teacher’s careful teaching (although it’s a pity that due to factors such as bad weather and long-distance epidemics, I missed a lot of opportunities to practice the actual swing...especially the original The team competition (QQ) arranged in the last few weeks of the semester not only became more familiar with the sport of woodball, but also became more confident in my sports skills (?)!

630cf1c240e337e60fce1470,希望老師寫板書能有明確方向（例如由左至右、由上至下）而非挑空白處寫，學生抄寫時會比較有條理。另外希望老師提到法條時，可以再重複一次或說慢一些，有時查法典較慢，會跟不上。老師聲音宏亮有精神，下課同學問問題時，總是很有耐心地回答，謝謝老師。,"It is hoped that the teacher can have a clear direction when writing on the blackboard (for example, from left to right, from top to bottom) instead of picking blank spaces to write, so that students will be more organized when copying. In addition, I hope that when the teacher mentions the law, he can repeat it again or speak slowly. Sometimes it is too slow to look up the law code, and he will not be able to keep up.

630cf1c140e337e60fce1274,教授有時候會突然卡住，感覺教授在上課前可以再複習一下這些功能，這樣課堂可以進行得更順利～另外這堂課本系學生在上課時常常聊天，上課品質大受影響，已經換過很多次座位，但身邊總有不停聊天的同學，無法理解學生繳學費上課，還不好好聽課心態為何，建議教授上課能夠要求學生就算不聽課，至少別聊天影響其他同學學習。,"Sometimes the professor gets stuck suddenly. I feel that the professor can review these functions before the class, so that the class can go more smoothly~ In addition, the students in this class often chat during the class, which greatly affects the quality of the class. I have changed many The second seat, but there are always classmates chatting non-stop. I can’t understand why students pay tuition fees to attend classes and don’t pay attention to the class mentality.

630cf1c140e337e60fce1272,希望老師能夠自己操作給學生看，而不是一直放操作影片給我們看。如果老師只需要一直放影片來進行教學的話，學生自己上網找學習影片就好了，根本不需要老師來上課。,"I hope that the teacher can operate it for the students by himself, instead of showing us the operation video all the time. If the teacher only needs to play videos all the time for teaching, students can just find learning videos online, and there is no need for teachers to come to class at all.",921,325,0,3,0.2111966609954834

630cf1c140e337e60fce12b1,不理解傳社為何在教免費學；老師上課常常只是考我們文本或者再講一次文本的內容。沒感受到說要考驗我們抓重點的能力，老師ppt大標小標就是文本的..。四堂課之間沒有連結，老師們各講各的，不了解本堂課核心概念（我有持續回去看課堂目標）希望老師們可以重新討論四個老師的課堂深度是否需要一致、課堂之間的連結與完整性等，對學生學習非常關鍵的問題。,"I don't understand why Chuanshe is teaching free learning; teachers often just test our text or explain the content of the text again. I didn't feel that we should test our ability to grasp the key points. The teacher's ppt with large and small scales is the text... There is no connection between the four classes. The teachers each speak in their own way. They don’t understand the core concepts of this class (I have to keep going back to see the class goals). I hope the teachers can re-discuss whether the depth of the four teachers’ classes needs to be consistent, and the differences between classes.

630cf1c240e337e60fce149f,老師上課很有活力，而且講解的都很清楚，如果有不會的地方也會再次講解。,"The teacher is very energetic in the class, and the explanations are very clear. If there is something that I don't know, I will explain it again.",841,359,0,1,0.9995187520980835
630cf1c240e337e60fce1477,老師和助教都是我在政大遇到最好最認真的!不過希望助教的講義可以早一點給我們，不然考試前三天才拿到厚厚的講義真的讀得很趕,"The teachers and teaching assistants are the best and most serious ones I have met in National Chengchi University!

630cf1c140e337e60fce1343,真心建議老師不要花太多時間在讓一個一同學回答問題上，有很多其他方式可以讓同學練習，像是跟隔壁同學輪流說等等，老師可以再統一教學發音或選幾題讓同學發言就好，全部都練習太浪費時間了，可以拿這些時間去補充更多內容，我覺得會更有益處。,"I sincerely suggest that teachers do not spend too much time on asking students to answer questions one by one. There are many other ways for students to practice, such as taking turns talking with the students next door, etc. The teacher can then unify teaching pronunciation or choose a few questions for students to speak. Well, practicing all of them is a waste of time, and I think it will be more beneficial to use this time to add more content.",323,246,0,1,0.0012378692626953125

630cf1c140e337e60fce1349,雖然老師解釋過為何不用線上會議軟體遠距，但還是比較希望用能互動的方式上課，臉書直播有時候會當掉，實在很擔心漏聽東西又不能及時反應⋯⋯但還是很喜歡老師的課！,"Although the teacher explained why he doesn’t use online conference software for remote meetings, he still prefers to use an interactive way to attend classes. Sometimes the Facebook live broadcast will fail. class!",323,246,0,1,0.0027655959129333496
630cf1c140e337e60fce12b0,每一位老師講的東西都很有趣！不過有時會搞不清楚四位老師之間的脈絡，會因此搞混、無法串聯。靜之老師上課時讓人很清醒，也和同學互動充分，但是有時候問問題會有些咄咄逼人，有些問題不太能理解老師究竟想要什麼回答。雖然也是種思考的練習，但是有時讓人挫折。希望老師可以節奏慢一些～,"Every teacher taught something very interesting! However, sometimes the connection between the four teachers is not clear, and because of this, they get confused and cannot be connected in series. Teacher Jingzhi is very clear-headed in class and fully interacts with students, but sometimes she is a bit aggressive when asking questions, and some questions do not understand what the teacher wants to answer.

630cf1c240e337e60fce15df,課程安排很怪，重複的內容太多，期中考考左直拳結果該節課還新教一堆東西，令人不解。 無關課程的資訊或訓話過多，不如拿來練習。 遠距後僅有每周練習進度，也沒有提供教學影片進行動作參考；說要WM5點名殊不知WM5上根本沒有拳擊課，令人無所適從。在完全沒影片或其他參考的情況下有同學禮貌提問，還被指責沒上課，罵完人也沒提供解答，教學態度堪慮。 教學內容上蠻好的，老師講了很多動作細節跟要領，但是這些外圍的缺點已經影響到整體上課品質。,"The course arrangement is very strange, there are too many repetitions, and the result of the midterm exam is Zuo Zhiquan, and a lot of new things are taught in this class, which is puzzling. There is too much information or lectures irrelevant to the course, it is better to use it for practice. After a long distance, there is only weekly practice progress, and there is no instructional video for action reference; it is said that there is no boxing class on WM5, which makes people feel at a loss. In the absence of videos or other references, some students politely asked questions, and were accused of not attending class, and did not provide answers after scolding people. The teaching attitude was worrying. The teaching content is quite good.

630cf1c240e337e60fce1566,希望老師在個人的書評報告和散文上，能給予實質的建議。期末測驗盡量以課堂講授知識為主，課外題容易偏離本課程主題。,"I hope that the teacher can give substantive suggestions on personal book review reports and essays.

630cf1c240e337e60fce1571,老師人很溫和也很樂意幫助學生解決學習上的困擾，然因爲審計對於初學者來說仍需要一點時間吸收，由同學自行規劃查核報告還是有點艱難，希望老師可以針對報告可以有更多時間的引導。,"The teachers are very gentle and willing to help students solve their learning problems. However, because the audit still takes a little time for beginners to absorb, it is still a bit difficult for students to plan the audit report by themselves.

630cf1c240e337e60fce1562,老師人超好，也很能跟學生打成一片。上課會偶爾有些小活動，輕鬆活潑。在教材的取材上除了有比較傳統的張愛玲之外，也會談到跟我們比較接近的俗女養成記、做工的人等，覺得老師很用心。書評及散文老師都一篇篇寫上評語，以鼓勵學生寫作為主，讓我增加了不少信心。很喜歡這堂散文課，謝謝老師。,"The teachers are super nice and get along well with the students. There will be occasional small activities in class, which are relaxed and lively. In addition to the more traditional Eileen Chang, the materials used in the teaching materials also talked about the stories of vulgar girls who are closer to us and people who work, and I feel that the teacher is very attentive.

630cf1c240e337e60fce15e0,改為線上上課後，老師並未明確通知所有同學改為線上後的評分標準、上課模式等等，好幾位同學在老師所創建的line群組裡詢問老師，老師卻以已在之前實體上課時說明過，我認為在改為線上上課前，已經有多名學生因不可抗力的因素（疫情隔離非常多）無法到課，老師應該在改為線上後統一說明，且之後上課的模式皆以文字敘述該做的內容，此部分沒問題，只是在同學詢問如何做任何上課內容的證明或點名時，老師皆未回答，到期末時學生才自行發現教學平台上出現缺席狀況，陸續詢問老師，皆未得到明確回答，讓學生不知所措。,"After switching to online classes, the teacher did not clearly inform all students of the grading criteria and class mode after switching to online. Several students asked the teacher in the line group created by the teacher, but the teacher said that they had already attended the physical class before.

The teacher should explain it uniformly after switching to online classes, and the mode of attending classes after that will be described in words There is no problem with this part of the content that should be done. It is just that when the students asked how to prove any class content or roll call, the teacher did not answer.

630cf1c140e337e60fce13f5,老師教學認真，講義內容豐富。我認為講義內容可以用ppt的最新版本，以免學生的版本不相容導致部分毀損。,"The teacher is serious in teaching and the lectures are rich in content.

630cf1c240e337e60fce14ef,覺得老師上課很認真，講解的也很清楚，動作有錯都會不厭其煩地幫我們調整。但是真的超可惜，好不容易選上這堂課，結果最期待的分組賽一次都沒有打到就遠距了 :\(,"I feel that the teacher is very serious in class, and the explanation is very clear.

630cf1c240e337e60fce164f,演講安排得太緊湊且密集，相當疲勞；有些講者的民族主義心態較重，演講時能感覺到對主流社會/文化或科學的有偏見的敵意，或者談論議題時，忽視了這個議題可能是經濟結構性問題，只從族群關係的角度分析。,"Lectures are arranged too closely and densely, which is quite exhausting; some speakers have a strong nationalistic attitude, and can feel prejudiced hostility to mainstream society/culture or science when speaking, or when talking about an issue, ignoring the issue may be Economic structural issues are only analyzed from the perspective of ethnic relations.",819,372,0,3,0.0009526610374450684

630cf1c240e337e60fce158d,請老師認真講解每一課的內容，不要覺得時間不夠、教不完就上傳影片讓學生自主學習。期中考後14課的て形已經要講4星期了，然後要考到20課，教不完叫學生回家自己看影片，教不完不會調整考的內容？硬要考這麼多？上課補充一堆生字又不考，但形容詞過去式變化上學期先補充給學生再考試，但明明下學期會教！其他補充生字沒有要考。浪費時間。 拜託老師請認真評量教學進度後再決定考試內容（課數） 課程程度屬基礎至初級，希望不要嘗試用越級的小考來磨滅學生對課程的興趣（例如口語小考100分時間要求苛刻）,"Please ask the teacher to carefully explain the content of each lesson, and don’t upload videos for students to learn independently if they feel that there is not enough time and the teaching cannot be finished. After the mid-term exam, the て form of the 14th class has been taught for 4 weeks, and then the 20th class will be tested. If the teaching is not finished, the students will be asked to go home and watch the video by themselves. If the teaching is not finished, the content of the exam will not be adjusted?

630cf1c140e337e60fce1400,教授課講得很不錯，但是考試的時候或寫作業都會看不太懂題目跟課程的連結，說不定教授以後上課可以多帶一點考試時會常出現的題型讓同學練習理解,"The professor's lectures are very good, but during the exam or when writing homework, I can't understand the connection between the topic and the course. Maybe the professor can bring some more questions that often appear in the exam to let the students practice understanding.",99,342,0,1,0.16247034072875977

630cf1c140e337e60fce1425,老師人很好，跑步的時候也會鼓勵同學不要放棄。每次跑完步也會帶著我們一起做核心跟伸展。真的很喜歡上老師的課！遠距反而對我來說是一大損失😭真的很謝謝老師又開始運動並且重新喜歡上運動！,"The teacher is very kind and encourages the students not to give up when running.

630cf1c240e337e60fce1479,老師講話易於重複一樣的話，實體上課真的會覺得很沒效率，繞來繞去都講一樣的話真的聽不下去，雖然老師可能想要鞏固所授之知識，但進度好像落後其他班很多，雖然期中考很輕鬆，但上課真的會覺得很不耐煩，因為一直聽到重複的話，每堂課一開始也會重複上禮拜的東西講很久，然後常常晚下課但上課又超級準時，一打中就直接上課，壓力也頗大,"The teacher tends to repeat the same things when speaking, and it is really inefficient to attend the class in person. It is really hard to listen to the same things after going around and around. Although the teacher may want to consolidate the knowledge taught, the progress seems to be far behind other classes. Although the midterm exam is very easy, I really feel very impatient in class, because I keep hearing repeated words, and each class will repeat the things of last week for a long time at the beginning of each class, and then I often end class late but class is super punctual, and I hit a dozen Just go to class directly, and the pressure is quite high",920,352,0,1,0.009656310081481934
630cf1c240e337e60fce14ed,很可惜這學期因為疫情的關係，沒有辦法進行到最後的排名賽，雖然一開始對木球不太熟悉，但老師還蠻照顧大家的，當觀察到我們的動作有誤時，會主動上前指導、示範～之後有機會想再修老師開的其他課！,"It is a pity that due to the epidemic situation this semester, there is no way to proceed to the final ranking competition.

630cf1c240e337e60fce1639,我是上學期有跟助教反應上台講題目評分標準的學生。這學期有改善很感謝老師與助教。  在我的認知中，老師出這項上台講解別有用心，但實際的狀況可能不太理想，我看到許多人只為了分數而講，且台下很少有人在聽，因此會建議是否能變成作業的方式，助教課就讓助教補充或複習。,"I am a student who reported to the teaching assistant last semester to give a lecture on the scoring criteria of the topic. I am very grateful to the teachers and teaching assistants for the improvement this semester. In my opinion, the teacher has ulterior motives in explaining this on stage, but the actual situation may not be ideal. I saw many people speaking only for the sake of scores, and few people in the audience were listening, so I would suggest whether it can be turned into homework In this way, the teaching assistant class will be supplemented or reviewed by the teaching assistant.",327,376,0,1,0.009336590766906738
630cf1c240e337e60fce1678,我覺得老師的上課方式很清楚，功課雖然有點難，要花很多時間，但是真的可以訓練到自己財務管理計算能力。我覺得老師可以考慮看看用別的方式出作業，因為用connect網站其實對很多學生負擔會很大，再加上要用到財務計算機，所以給老師一點點小建議。,"I think the teacher's teaching method is very clear. Although the homework is a bit difficult and takes a lot of time, it can really train one's financial management and calculation skills. I think the teacher can consider using other ways to produce homework, because using the connect website will actually put a lot of burden on many students, and in addition to using a financial computer, I would like to give the teacher a little suggestion.",122,379,0,3,0.9805681109428406

630cf1c240e337e60fce15f7,雖然我不是商院的學生，修完這堂課也覺得這方面不適合我，但還是很謝謝老師><我覺得我收穫很多（但還是希望期末有考試選項...,"Although I am not a student of the business school, I feel that this aspect is not suitable for me after taking this course, but I am still very grateful to the teacher><I think I have gained a lot (but I still hope that there will be an exam option at the end of the semester...",272,722,0,1,0.9973345994949341
630cf1c240e337e60fce1679,每周上課內容明確，雖說有時會想睡，但老師講課很清楚明瞭,"The content of the weekly class is clear. Although I sometimes feel drowsy, the teacher's lectures are very clear",122,379,0,3,0.9994138479232788
630cf1c340e337e60fce1758,如果成績不理想一定是我沒有學好 嗚⋯ 因為半個學期要觸及基本權利的各個面向，一週一個主題的安排很合理，但考試的時候⋯,"If the grades are not satisfactory, it must be that I have not studied well. Huh... because half a semester has to touch all aspects of basic rights, the arrangement of one topic a week is very reasonable, but during the exam...",493,399,0,1,0.014440298080444336
630cf1c340e337e60fce17fb,大推永和！老師是個超可愛又有熱情的伯伯，講法蠻淺顯易懂的，讓我大一修經濟修的很快樂（但期中期末真的要乖乖讀助教課要好好上）,"Big push Yonghe! The teacher is a super cute and enthusiastic uncle, and his lectures are quite easy to understand, which made me very happy in the economics course in my freshman year (but I really have to study the teaching assistant class obediently at the end of the midterm and the end of the term)",99,394,0,1,0.9966228008270264
630cf1c240e337e60fce15f5,課堂作業負擔重，但是認真學習、討論，可以學到很多。老師上課有趣，充分結合生活內容，是堂值得推薦的好課。,"Classwork is heavy, but you can learn a lot by studying and discussing carefully. The teacher's class is interesting and fully integrated with the content of life. It is a good class worth recommending.",272,722,0,1,0.9998735189437866
630cf1c340e337e60fce17e4,老師人超好，教得也很清楚，會用很簡單的例子說明，不懂也都可以問。但可能我吸收比較慢吧，每次準備期中期末壓力都好大QAQ ，怕自己讀不完或考得很差，希望老師能放水哈哈,"The teacher is super nice, and he teaches very clearly. He will explain with simple examples, and you can ask questions if you don't understand. But maybe I absorb it slowly. Every time I prepare for the middle and end of the semester, I feel a lot of pressure QAQ. I am afraid that I will not be able to finish reading or do poorly in the exam. I hope the teacher can release the water haha",99,394,0,1,0.9589715003967285
630cf1c240e337e60fce169e,老師提供哲學家的哲學思想大綱圖對同學的學習很有幫助,"The teacher provides an outline map of philosophers' philosophical thoughts, which is very helpful for students to learn",935,391,0,1,0.9991573095321655

630cf1c240e337e60fce1637,建議可以補充課本跳過部分，課本有提的反而可以給學生自行閱讀。,"It is suggested that the skipped parts of the textbook can be supplemented, and those mentioned in the textbook can be read by the students themselves.",327,376,0,1,0.003585219383239746
630cf1c340e337e60fce17ee,大一的經濟學能遇到老師實在是太好了，雖然我可能考試成績不太好，但是老師的經濟學真的讓我獲益良多，而且很好懂，真的非常謝謝老師的教導!,"It’s great to meet a teacher in my freshman year of economics. Although my test scores may not be very good, the teacher’s economics has really benefited me a lot and is easy to understand. Thank you very much for the teacher’s teaching !",99,394,0,1,0.9998420476913452
630cf1c340e337e60fce1801,這堂課老師從一開學就延續上學期採用遠距+實體方式進行，非常好，到現場聽過一次有不懂的地方回去都能再做一次複習，尤其這學期內容涵蓋個經及總經，相對難，且這學期老師上課節奏明顯比上學期要快很多，因此能重看影片算是對學習幫助非常大。討論課的部分，因為遠距的關係似乎就失去了意義，但這也沒辦法，另外也希望各助教的討論課評分一該要一致，雖然只有20%但影響也蠻大，每個班的成績卻不太一樣，似乎不太公平。另外這學期少了選擇題，能夠練習的題目就變少了，希望以後還是能提供選擇題。感謝老師助教。,"The teacher used the remote + physical method to conduct this class from the beginning of the semester. It is very good. I have heard it once on the spot and can review it again when I go back. Especially this semester covers the individual classics and the general manager. , relatively difficult, and the teacher's teaching pace this semester is obviously much faster than last semester, so being able to re-watch the movie is very helpful for learning. The discussion part seems to lose its meaning because of the long-distance relationship, but this can’t be helped. In addition, I also hope that the scores of the discussion courses of each teaching assistant should be consistent. Although it is only 20%, the impact is quite large. The results are not the same, it seems unfair. In addition, there are fewer multiple-choice questions this semester, and fewer questions can be practiced. I hope that multiple-choice questions can still be provided in the future. Thanks teacher assistant.",99,394,0,1,0.9608798623085022
630cf1c240e337e60fce1656,老師人超級好，雖然會點人回答問題但都不會有什麼壓力，老師都用愛的教育鼓勵大家,"The teachers are super nice. Although they can point people to answer questions, there is no pressure. The teachers encourage everyone with love education",936,723,0,3,0.9996758699417114

630cf1c340e337e60fce181f,每周會上1-2個章節，整體而言負擔不會太大，是門不錯的課。但小組討論會用到下課時間，希望老師可以考慮前兩小時講授後一小時討論分享，也比較不會混亂!,"There will be 1-2 chapters per week. Overall, the burden will not be too great, and it is a good class. But the group discussion will use the end of class time, I hope the teacher can consider the first two hours of lectures and then one hour of discussion and sharing, so that there will be less confusion!",9,400,0,1,0.06849199533462524
630cf1c340e337e60fce1822,老師很用心認真 也很鼓勵同學說出自己的想法 不過管理學本身就比較抽象 在應用上也缺乏合適的場域 如果沒有親身領導過團隊可能比較難帶入 還是謝謝老師這學期的教學 有感受到老師的用心,"The teacher is very earnest and encourages students to express their ideas. However, management itself is relatively abstract and lacks a suitable field for application. If you have not personally led a team, it may be difficult to bring in.

630cf1c340e337e60fce1926,臧老師是超級認真的老師，更是專精於自己的研究領域，對於特定議題的理解非常到位，總是能夠針對議題整理出自己的一套邏輯體系，並精準的以口述方式傳達給學生理解，非常少數的老師能做到如此程度，我非常佩服。在本課程課堂報告及討論時，老師總是能引導大家思考，給予大家很棒的建議，私底下更是照顧學生，很樂意跟大家聊聊。修習這堂課後，我不只獲得了很多的知識，也增進了研究、報告及表達的能力，實在獲益良多。,"Teacher Zang is a super serious teacher who specializes in his own research field. He has a good understanding of specific issues. He can always sort out his own logical system for the issues and accurately convey them to students in an oral way. , very few teachers can do so, I admire very much. During the class reports and discussions of this course, the teacher can always guide everyone to think and give you great suggestions.

630cf1c340e337e60fce1943,老師上課不但會顧慮在台學生，也會很關心很重視在外國的學生，考慮到時差的部分老師都會調整作業、上課、考試測驗的進行方式。很貼心，很棒！上課內容紮實，作業loading也還好。老師是日本人，授課語言是英語，但英文很淺白易懂，而且語速也不會很快，所以聽課的時候也不會感到很困擾。,"Teachers will not only worry about students in Taiwan, but also care about students in foreign countries. Some teachers will adjust the way of homework, class, and exams in consideration of time difference. Very thoughtful and great!

630cf1c340e337e60fce19c2,老師超級幽默，即使是下午的課也不容易恍神打瞌睡。上課內容也非常扎實，受益良多。唯一的小建議是希望老師的語速可以放慢一點點。,"The teacher is super humorous, and it is not easy to doze off even in the afternoon class.

630cf1c240e337e60fce15f4,這學期最喜歡的課就是白老師的行銷管理！雖然作業量很大，也常常覺得很麻煩，但當做出成果時又會很自豪。老師上課時也非常鼓勵學生回答問題，雖然我並不是踴躍發言的人，比起主動發言更習慣在心中講出答案，但希望老師還是可以了解到我是很認真上課的學生＞＜，最後謝謝老師這學期的教導，能幸運灌檔到老師的必修真的太開心了。,"My favorite class this semester is Teacher Bai's Marketing Management!

630cf1c340e337e60fce181d,我覺得教授每堂課都讓我們討論不同觀念，而不是播電影或是一直聽演講，受益良多，希望教授可以一直保持此教學模式！,"I think the professor let us discuss different ideas in every class, instead of playing movies or listening to lectures all the time, which has benefited a lot.

The teacher is really cute, and often shares some short stories from the practical world, instead of just narrating textbooks or academic concepts, it can deepen my concept of the operation of debt clauses!

630cf1c240e337e60fce1664,還蠻喜歡老師授課的方式，但想要建議的點就是，希望老師在遠距線上課程時可以試著做簡報，因為老師每次在寫小黑板時，其實常常是看不清楚上面的字的，也可能是網路問題，所以有時候上課就會比較容易分心，還有，如果能有簡報的話，學生也能更融入在課堂中，分心時也比較能迅速地回到老師在講的地方。,"I quite like the way the teacher teaches, but what I want to suggest is that I hope the teacher can try to make presentations during the long-distance online class, because every time the teacher writes on the small blackboard, the words on it are often not clear , it may also be a network problem, so sometimes it is easier to get distracted in class, and if there is a presentation, students can also be more integrated into the class, and they can return to the teacher's lecture more quickly when they are distracted.

630cf1c240e337e60fce16a1,老師的上課速度蠻快的，許多東西還來不及理解就到下一個段落了，實體上課比較還好，但線上上課用螢幕分享的方式筆記就比較容易漏掉，可能西哲一次要教這麼多位哲學家的系統還是算蠻多的，變成上課速度要很快QQ，但老師還是很樂於解答學生問題ㄉ。,"The teacher's class is very fast, and many things are too late to understand before going to the next paragraph. It is better to take physical classes, but it is easier to miss notes in the online class with screen sharing. Maybe Xizhe has to teach so many philosophists at a time There are still quite a lot of systems at home, and it is very fast to turn into QQ for class, but the teacher is still very happy to answer students' questionsㄉ.",935,391,0,1,0.9905669093132019

630cf1c340e337e60fce183e,老師自稱歐陸為燕菁最涼課，但我覺得這門課與其說是最涼課，不如說是自由。老師不會逼我們一定要做到甚麼事情，而是讓我們自由的去念書、討論，並且集體一起進步。如果你想要涼，那這門課可以很涼，但如果你想要學東西，絕對不枉此行。老師將歐盟的內容都整理得好好，只要你想學就能夠獲得以前從沒想過的新知，同時老師會帶我們去歐洲節玩，來去跟真正的歐洲人互動，去認識我們所不知道的歐洲，真的很涼很好玩，雖然我確診沒去到歐洲節qqqq但這課修了真的不會後悔!!!!!,"The teacher called Ou Lu Yanjing's coolest class, but I think this class is more about freedom than the coolest class. The teacher will not force us to do something, but let us read, discuss, and make progress collectively.

As long as you want to learn, you can get new knowledge that you have never thought of before. At the same time, the teacher will take us to the European Festival to interact with real Europeans and get to know what we don’t know.

630cf1c240e337e60fce1635,老師真的教得很好，但希望老師考前可以粗淺的說明考試方向，不然對於沒有考古題的學生不太公平。,"The teacher is really good at teaching, but I hope the teacher can briefly explain the direction of the exam before the exam, otherwise it will not be fair to students who do not have archaeological questions.",327,376,0,1,0.008645236492156982

630cf1c240e337e60fce167b,我認為教授上課的步調以及內容都十分有趣，但我不確定是教授的聲音還說語氣總讓我搖搖欲睡…或許在課程中，可以不時加入小題目來詢問同學，或者分組讓小組討論是個可以拉回大家注意力的方法。另外對於教授期中考的形式我想當滿意，既能夠讓認真同學有所回報，又能夠有鑑別度，希望可以繼續保持。,"I think the pace and content of the professor's class are very interesting, but I'm not sure it's the professor's voice and tone that always make me sleepy...Maybe in the course, you can add small questions from time to time to ask students, or divide the group for groups Discussion is a way to get everyone's attention back. In addition, I want to be satisfied with the format of the professor's midterm exam. It can not only reward serious students, but also have a degree of discrimination.

It can cultivate students' ability to grasp the sense of direction by looking at the map, and can also enhance their physical fitness.

630cf1c240e337e60fce1633,同為大學外文日文，老師的進度相較其他班真的過慢，且教學內容有時候會教到超出進度的東西。例如在變化上一次教了很多，但並沒有詳細解說這些用法，且這些文型也並非學生現在程度能用得到的。此外，在講解丁寧體與普通體的差別可能要更清楚，老師有時候會說都可以，可能會讓學生對此概念有不足。雖然老師樂於補充日本文化，但有時候影片會播太久，相較同課名的日文課扎實程度差異滿大的。,"It is also a university foreign language Japanese, the teacher's progress is really too slow compared to other classes, and the teaching content sometimes teaches things beyond the progress. For example, a lot of changes were taught at one time, but these usages were not explained in detail, and these styles are not available to students at the current level. In addition, it may be more clear when explaining the difference between Dingning style and ordinary style. Teachers sometimes say that it is okay, which may make students lack this concept. Although the teacher is happy to supplement the Japanese culture, sometimes the video will be played for too long, and there is a big difference in the level of solidity compared to the Japanese class with the same name.",930,380,0,3,0.21617305278778076

The teacher's lectures are like a composition, which is very pleasant to the ear. The teacher insists on not finishing the class.

630cf1c340e337e60fce193c,後期報告的討論時間因為讀書報告的關係變的很少，我認為這影響了這堂課要完成一個大的研究計劃的主要目的。另外半個學期的研究時間已經十分吃緊，再塞一個讀書報告除了十分占用課堂時間外，相信多數同學也並不會有太高的興趣在自己研究吃緊得情況下閱讀其他東西。另外一人八千字的期末報告真的太過於雞肋，畢竟我們真的沒有像碩士生一般一年以上的時間去好好的完成一份研究，更不用說2小時以上的逐字稿。但整體來說文本的選讀真的很棒，是好書單。,"The discussion time of the later report is less because of the book report. I think this affects the main purpose of this class to complete a large research plan. The research time for the other half of the semester is already very tight. Apart from taking up a lot of class time, I believe that most students will not have too much interest in reading other things when their own research is tight. In addition, the 8,000-word final report for one person is really too tasteless. After all, we really don’t have more than a year to complete a research like a master’s student, let alone a verbatim draft of more than 2 hours. But on the whole, the selection of texts is really good, and it is a good book list.",496,403,0,1,0.7575060129165649
630cf1c340e337e60fce18cd,老師的上課方式比較特別，所以剛開始比較難適應，但後來適應之後就成功跟上老師上課的步調了。建議老師可以在學期初就公布詳細的作業和報告要求。,"The teacher's teaching method is quite special, so it was difficult to adapt at first, but after adapting, I managed to keep up with the pace of the teacher's class. It is recommended that teachers can announce detailed assignment and report requirements at the beginning of the semester.",941,409,0,1,0.9988685846328735
630cf1c340e337e60fce1919,很喜歡老師幽默的互動，雖然自己有點內向有時候不敢表達哈哈！ 其實一直想參與討論或是回答問題，也知道老師很友善不會咬人，但就是每次想回答前都會想好久好久，也有可能是跟自己的準備度有關係。如果可以的話感覺討論形式可以指定每週兩組人一定得參與討論，也讓同學在固定有一問一答的狀況下建立起在課堂對話的信心和默契,"I really like the teacher's humorous interaction, although I am a bit introverted and sometimes dare not express it haha! In fact, I have always wanted to participate in discussions or answer questions, and I know that the teacher is very friendly and will not bite, but every time I want to answer, I think for a long time before answering, and it may have something to do with my preparation. If it is possible, I feel that the form of discussion can specify that two groups of people must participate in the discussion every week, and it will also allow students to build confidence and tacit understanding in class dialogues under the fixed situation of one question and one answer",939,405,3,3,0.9968446493148804

Here is a little suggestion for the teacher><The group report does allow us to have a more detailed understanding of the interpretation of characters independently, but in the second half of the semester, the first class report is often delayed so that the teacher will not have time to finish the course content or It’s a pity to skip a lot of them directly. After all, some explanations are too complicated for us to explain in five minutes. Maybe there is a better way than reporting or each group is responsible for a little less explanations to balance the time. ..? Otherwise, there are only two hours of class time per week.

At the end of last semester, I saw that the teacher responded to the teaching evaluation, so I want to continue to leave a message to the teacher! I really like the teacher's class.

630cf1c240e337e60fce163b,這一年我最喜歡的老師！雖然我成績沒有很好，但老師的教學方式能引發學生對數學的興趣、偶爾的故事補充也可提升素養。  1.希望縮寫能再少一點 2.希望老師能提供上課的那張手稿給我們,"My favorite teacher this year! Although my grades are not very good, the teacher's teaching method can arouse students' interest in mathematics, and occasional story supplements can also improve literacy. 1.

630cf1c340e337e60fce17c2,老師教得很好，一開始就提醒下學期的課程難度加大，也多了練習題給我們寫。 很謝謝老師。,"The teacher taught us very well.

630cf1c240e337e60fce16c1,老師教學用心，雖然是英語授課，但用字簡單、不影響學生理解。且課堂中老師時常停頓問學生是否有問題，確保學生能跟上課程進度。課後Kahoot測驗也能即時幫學生檢驗學習效果。,"The teacher teaches attentively. Although the class is taught in English, the words used are simple and do not affect students' understanding. In addition, the teacher often pauses in class to ask students if they have any questions to ensure that students can keep up with the progress of the course. The Kahoot test after class can also help students test the learning effect in real time.",764,416,3,1,0.0007275938987731934

630cf1c240e337e60fce1632,希望老師能放慢速度教學，並且多增加一些補充還有帶著同學一個一個慢慢唸。可能自己在語言上還是偏好傳統的教學模式，會較喜歡用板書並且口頭帶領的方式去一步一步教學外語,"I hope the teacher can slow down the teaching speed, add more supplements and take the students to read slowly one by one. Maybe I still prefer the traditional teaching mode in terms of language, and I prefer to use blackboard writing and oral leadership to teach foreign languages step by step",930,380,0,3,0.005805671215057373
630cf1c240e337e60fce16f1,簡報內容有點散亂，在複習的時候會很混亂。 老師上課聲音有點太平。 課程內容有規劃！,"The content of the briefing is a bit scattered, which can be confusing when reviewing. The teacher's voice in class was a bit peaceful. The course content is planned!",764,416,0,1,0.04515516757965088

I learn a lot about the platform through the report and the teacher's feedback every week. The small class size also makes the relationship between the students better. It's really a pity that there are only six short weeks (but if the weekly report is at the end of the semester, it should be a blast), if you have more time, you should be able to learn more about the platform economy and innovation!",952,393,0,3,0.9878076910972595

630cf1c340e337e60fce18e2,優點是老師考試的題目與評分都算是對同學很友善，上課的時候老師也幽默風趣不無聊，同時教學深度很夠，對於重點地方的補充跟延伸都很足 ，另外就是上課都會錄影很讚，因為老師上課延伸與補充不少也不簡單非常需要重看或按暫停思考 但是對於有些細微的地方就跳躍有點快，複習很費勁，不但要把細節自己讀懂還要連老師上課延伸的都看懂,"The advantage is that the questions and scores of the teacher's exam are very friendly to the students. The teacher is also humorous and not boring during the class. At the same time, the teaching depth is sufficient, and the supplement and extension of the key points are sufficient. In addition, the video recording of the class is very good. Because it is not easy for the teacher to extend and supplement a lot in class, it is very necessary to re-read or pause to think, but for some subtle places, the jump is a bit fast, and the review is very laborious. Not only do you have to understand the details yourself, but you also have to read the teacher’s extended class. Understand",920,724,0,1,0.5513991117477417

630cf1c240e337e60fce1677,那個功課網站有點貴，雖然網站有他的好處，但是鼓勵老師多多推廣moodle，Moodle也可以出題跟給詳解，這樣可以省下一筆小錢。謝謝老師,"The homework website is a bit expensive.

630cf1c240e337e60fce1629,老師如果有事無法上課的話，建議老師可以先告知體育組，學生也比較不會在上課場地不知如何處理。,"If the teacher is unable to attend class due to something, it is suggested that the teacher can inform the sports team first, and students will be less likely to not know how to deal with it in the class venue.",474,378,0,1,0.0017378926277160645

630cf1c340e337e60fce1781,我是上學期分數沒有很好看的其中一位學生。這學期調整了學習方法，覺得羅老師是其實滿會教的，只是上課語速有點快，偶爾使沒有複習的學生沒辦法抓到重點。推薦老師可以在課前先向同學說明韓文的整體讀法，如要先預習、單字邊讀邊寫、複習可以如何做等等，讓學生可以更快進入狀況。除此之外，一切都很好，辛苦老師了！,"I'm one of those students whose grades didn't look good last semester. This semester, I have adjusted my learning method. I feel that Teacher Luo is really good at teaching, but the speed of speaking in class is a bit fast, which occasionally makes it difficult for students who have not reviewed to grasp the key points. It is recommended that the teacher explain the overall reading method of Korean to the students before class, such as previewing, reading and writing individual characters, how to do review, etc., so that students can get into the situation faster. Other than that, everything is fine, thank you teacher!",226,390,0,1,0.9948009252548218

630cf1c240e337e60fce1654,我認為老師教學目標明確，重點是對自身教授的領域熱忱極強，而這份熱愛也會影響到學生的學習動機。老師在國外留學的經驗使我們打開國際觀，並更加了解國外學術領域的發展與運作模式，對未來有意願到國外就讀研究所的同學很有幫助。再者，老師鼓勵師生互動，增強學生在課堂上的參與度並幫助同學集中注意力。最後，老師在課堂教學上邏輯明確、進度掌握得宜，於課程開始時會提供教學大綱，敘明課程需求與評分方式，且評分標準合理。教師有組織、有系統的表達教學內容使我獲益良多。,"I think teachers have clear teaching goals, and the key point is that they have a strong enthusiasm for the field they teach, and this love will also affect students' learning motivation. The teacher’s experience in studying abroad has opened up our international outlook, and we have a better understanding of the development and operation of foreign academic fields, which is very helpful for students who are willing to study abroad in graduate schools in the future. Furthermore, the teacher encourages teacher-student interaction, enhancing student participation in the classroom and helping classmates to focus. Finally, the teacher has clear logic and appropriate progress in classroom teaching. At the beginning of the course, the teacher will provide the syllabus, explain the course requirements and scoring methods, and the scoring standards are reasonable. I have benefited a lot from the teacher's organized and systematic expression of teaching content.",936,723,0,3,0.9994770884513855

630cf1c340e337e60fce183f,唯一支持燕菁老師 歐陸有比中憲不硬一點沒錯，但各個法律原則那邊還是挺混亂的，有了中憲和比政的基礎聽歐陸會很有應用感，真的要上過再來會比較好。 歐洲節也獲益良多，在歐洲節聽到的各國八卦非常有助於了解該國的情勢，回課堂上更有共鳴、更印象深刻。 總而言之，燕菁老師最棒了<3,"It is true that Ou Lu, the only teacher who supports Yanjing, is not tougher than Zhongxian, but the legal principles are still quite confusing. With the basis of Zhongxian and political comparison, Ou Lu will have a sense of application. I really want to go to the meeting again. Better. The European Festival also benefited a lot.

630cf1c340e337e60fce189c,課程負擔不重，閱讀的文獻很有趣，老師也很可愛，但實際課程因延宕而和教學大綱上的進度不太一樣，有時候會拖延到下一堂課的時間,"The course load is not heavy, the literature I read is very interesting, and the teacher is also very lovely, but the actual course is not at the same pace as the syllabus due to delays, and sometimes it will be delayed until the next class",947,727,0,1,0.06180697679519653

630cf1c340e337e60fce1764,謝謝燕菁這一年來的教導，老師不但是一位良師，更是一位益友。謝謝老師總是溫暖的關懷學生，無論是生活上或課業上的問題都樂於提供協助與建議，讓我們再徬徨的大學生涯有所指引。 這一年憲法的課程不講讓我學習到許多知識，更讓我了解看事情不能只看表面，更不能只看一方的講法，而是要將不同意見納入思考，再由自己做出獨立的判斷，並且好好的論述他，我想這也是政治系必修裡最有收穫的一堂課！也很謝謝老師總是做好身教，不斷提醒我們思考哪裡可以調整，這一年能在政大認識老師，認識中憲，真的很感動！,"Thank you Yanjing for teaching this year, the teacher is not only a good teacher, but also a good friend. Thank you teacher for always caring for students warmly, willing to provide assistance and advice no matter in life or academic problems, let us guide us in our uncertain university life. This year's constitutional course taught me a lot of knowledge, and it also made me understand that I can't just look at the surface of things, let alone just look at one side's teachings, but take different opinions into consideration, and then make independent decisions by myself Judging and discussing him well, I think this is also the most rewarding class in the compulsory political department! I am also very grateful to the teacher for always teaching us by example and constantly reminding us to think about where we can make adjustments. It is really touching to get to know the teacher and Zhongxian at National Chengchi University this year!",493,399,0,1,0.99982750415802
630cf1c240e337e60fce16ea,教授很認真,the professor is very serious,197,386,3,1,0.9997151494026184
630cf1c240e337e60fce16ee,老師教課用心，會解決同學們的疑惑。,The teacher teaches the class attentively and will solve the doubts of the students.,197,386,3,1,0.9995660185813904
630cf1c340e337e60fce17be,老師人很好，上課氣氛很棒，在難題上也會盡力表達清楚，很喜歡老師的課。比較建議老師在教空間類的知識時(e.g. 鞍點)可以使用電腦投影畫面，或是有呈現立體圖的教材，讓學生直接看到清楚的圖會比較能理解，另外這門課最大的缺點是課本習題解答的錯誤率極高，若是無法請出版社勘誤的話，希望上課時只要遇到錯誤的題目or解答就記錄下來，往後再教下一屆的時候可以拿出來用，提早讓他們知道這些問題。,"The teacher is very nice, the class atmosphere is great, and he will try his best to express clearly when it comes to difficult problems. I like the teacher's class very much. It is recommended that teachers can use computer projection screens when teaching spatial knowledge (e.g. saddle points), or have teaching materials that present three-dimensional pictures, so that students can understand them directly when they see the clear pictures. In addition, the biggest disadvantage of this course is The error rate in the answers to textbook exercises is extremely high. If you can’t ask the publisher to make corrections, I hope that as long as you encounter wrong questions or answers in class, you can record them and use them in the next class. Let them know in advance these questions.",96,383,0,1,0.024859845638275146
630cf1c240e337e60fce1721,非常有興趣學習機器學習，但這堂課對於一個初學者來說極為艱澀難懂，要在短一個學期理解許多原理和因子投資，完全不可能，平均一個方法僅一張投影片，加上一堆程式碼，此外以英文教學更提升學習困難度，雖然老師及助教面對同學的疑問都很熱心解答，但當完全聽不懂時，也不太知道要怎麼問了。強烈建議範圍應調整，否則就是要先修高等數學、高等統計、Ｒ，甚至是機器學習，就我的感覺這堂課比較像複習這些知識，並整合與應用之，然而對一個完全不懂的學生而言，猶如天書，花了許多時間學習，仍趕不上進度，只好放棄。,"I am very interested in learning machine learning, but this class is extremely difficult for a beginner. It is completely impossible to understand many principles and factor investment in a short semester. On average, there is only one slide for one method, plus one Stacking code, in addition, teaching in English makes learning more difficult. Although teachers and teaching assistants are very enthusiastic about answering students' questions, they don't know how to ask when they don't understand at all. It is strongly recommended that the scope should be adjusted, otherwise it is necessary to take advanced mathematics, advanced statistics, R, or even machine learning first. As far as I feel, this class is more like reviewing these knowledge, and integrating and applying it. For students, it is like a bible. After spending a lot of time studying, they still can't keep up with the progress, so they have to give up.",933,721,3,3,0.006079316139221191
630cf1c240e337e60fce16f0,老師每次下課前，都會讓我們進行kahoot 測驗，簡單基本的問題同時能幫我們對當天上的內容做整理與理解。我覺得老師分數分配得很平均。,The teacher will ask us to take the kahoot test every time before class. Simple and basic questions can help us organize and understand the content of the day. I think the teacher's grades are distributed fairly evenly.,764,416,0,1,0.8844463229179382

630cf1c240e337e60fce164d,希望最後一堂課的進度不要那麼快，有點難吸收，當下很難立即造句。,"I hope the progress of the last class is not so fast, it is a bit difficult to absorb, and it is difficult to make sentences immediately.",930,375,0,3,0.0003934502601623535
630cf1c340e337e60fce177b,老師備課很認真、講話風趣，整體課堂氛圍很好！遠距教學規劃很完善、網站也很方便，使用起來簡單明瞭，而且老師很注重學生的想法，期中期末作業會跟同學討論再做調整，覺得很讚！雖然到了高韓越來越難，但因為上課蠻有趣的，所以都會很期待上課，是大學少數覺得上課很愉快的課，大推～～,"The teacher prepares lessons seriously, speaks humorously, and the overall classroom atmosphere is very good! The distance teaching plan is very complete, the website is also very convenient, it is simple and clear to use, and the teacher pays great attention to the students' ideas. The mid-term and final homework will be discussed with the students before making adjustments. I think it is very good! Although it is getting more and more difficult in Gaohan, but because the class is quite interesting, so I look forward to the class, it is one of the few classes in the university that I think the class is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it~~",308,390,0,3,0.9997861981391907

630cf1c240e337e60fce1683,可以善用moodle公告考試、作業、公布事項等等，不然全部用email繳交或宣達事項很容易漏掉，或是不知道老師有沒有收到作業信。用教學平台會比較方便！,"You can make good use of moodle to announce exams, assignments, announcements, etc. Otherwise, it is easy to miss all the submissions or announcements by email, or you may not know whether the teacher has received the assignment letter. It will be more convenient to use the teaching platform!",930,375,0,3,0.000331878662109375

630cf1c340e337e60fce18a6,老師上課很有耐心跟細心，上課內容後期越來越難，英語上課方式會教難以完全理解老師想要表達的意思。但整體上課學到很多。,The teacher is very patient and careful in class. The content of the class becomes more and more difficult in the later stage. The way of teaching English will make it difficult to fully understand what the teacher wants to express. But overall I learned a lot in class.,678,427,3,1,0.9282452464103699
630cf1c340e337e60fce189d,老師上課很認真，會說很多補充的東西，對同學的報告和問題也都很用心地回答，只是可能要注意一下上課進度。另外，上課的文本我覺得選得很好，涉及很多領域，讀起來很有趣。,"The teacher is very serious in class, he will say a lot of supplementary things, and he also answers the students' reports and questions very carefully, but you may have to pay attention to the progress of the class. In addition, I think the texts of the class are well selected, covering many fields, and it is very interesting to read.",947,727,0,1,0.9990357160568237

630cf1c340e337e60fce18f4,老師能善用生活例子說明，非常好！希望可以調整理論概念及python的講課比例，建議偏重理論概念的內容，python的部份可能要影片代替，效果更佳,"The teacher can make good use of life examples to explain, very good! I hope that the proportion of theoretical concepts and python lectures can be adjusted. It is recommended to focus on the content of theoretical concepts. The python part may be replaced by videos, the effect is better",678,427,0,1,0.8574150800704956
630cf1c340e337e60fce18f5,老師上課很棒講的也很清楚，但是我覺得可以多一點停頓讓學生可以完全理解，我記得中間有一堂課的內容比較複雜，上課的時候其實聽不太懂，然後這堂課又是落後一點點後面就會更聽不懂的那種，所以有時候會覺得比較吃力，但整體來說還是很棒。,"The teacher is very good in the class and the lectures are very clear, but I think there should be more pauses so that the students can fully understand. I remember that there was a class in the middle where the content was more complicated. I didn’t really understand it during the class, and then this class fell behind. After a little bit, it will become more incomprehensible, so sometimes it will be more difficult, but overall it is still great.",678,427,0,1,0.9985199570655823
630cf1c340e337e60fce18d7,喜歡啟洲的教學方式！總能補充很多相關資訊給我們！,I love Qizhou's teaching style! You can always add a lot of relevant information to us!,920,724,0,1,0.9998414516448975

630cf1c240e337e60fce16fe,期末報告想讓學生應用知識的起心動念很好，但我們才初識會計，很容易垃圾進垃圾出，學生做的心酸，老師看得也浪費時間。希望老師之後可以改成一堂由老師實務分析財務報表，相信對雙方來說都會更有價值。其餘而言，老師教得非常好，課程內容做為初會也滿深的。辛苦老師一年的教導。,"The end-of-term report is a good idea to let students apply knowledge, but we are just new to accounting, and it is easy for garbage to go in and out. The students feel sad and the teacher sees it as a waste of time. I hope that the teacher can change it to a class where the teacher analyzes the financial statements in practice. I believe it will be more valuable to both parties. In other words, the teacher taught very well, and the content of the course is also very deep as a beginner. The hard work of the teacher for a year of teaching.",764,416,0,1,0.04569089412689209
630cf1c240e337e60fce15f0,我覺得報告可以多給範本，並且針對各項作業能夠有更多meeting的機會，大家會更清楚知道怎麼做，或是每週的報告就可以加減以書面方式提供給助教或老師做註解修改，不然其實課程內容到實作還是有個坎，企劃內容相對來說也會更臻完整。,"I think the report can provide more templates, and there will be more meeting opportunities for each assignment. Everyone will know how to do it more clearly, or the weekly report can be added or subtracted in writing and provided to the teaching assistant or teacher for annotation and revision. Otherwise, there is still a hurdle from the course content to the implementation, and the planning content will be relatively more complete.",272,722,0,1,0.025483131408691406
630cf1c340e337e60fce17de,教授上課非常熱情認真，對課程的安排也非常有規劃，上課的過程教授也會跟學生們交流，讓我十分喜歡這門課，教授辛苦了，感謝這學期的指教。,"The professor is very enthusiastic and serious in the class, and the arrangement of the course is also very planned.

630cf1c240e337e60fce16b6,老師教的很詳細 然後會補充很多相關知識，有時候看韓劇聽到老師教過的文法，都會有一種「原來如此」的感覺 很謝謝老師用心幫我們打好基礎！,"The teacher teaches in detail and then adds a lot of relevant knowledge. Sometimes when watching Korean dramas and hearing the grammar taught by the teacher, there will be a feeling of ""that's how it is"".

630cf1c240e337e60fce15e8,老師讓我對行銷管理這門課產生了很大的興趣，因老師的授課方式很生動，我不僅在課堂上不打瞌睡，還越學越有勁！雖然認真上課，但考試成績不佳～,"The teacher made me very interested in the course of marketing management, because the teacher's teaching method is very lively, not only did I not doze off in class, but the more I learned, the more energetic I was!

630cf1c340e337e60fce1757,老師希望訓練我們把釋字從晦澀的轉換成易懂的，也培養了我們的閱讀理解能力，這學期的期中口試準備起來也較輕鬆(也許是有了前一學期的經驗加上這學期的內容多偏向實務應用較好發揮)，這學期都是以釋字作為教學背景，但想要帶出的是背後蘊含的道理以及大法官是如何思考及判斷的(燕菁常常把看似很遙遠的概念，帶到親近我們生活周遭的事例，對我們理解上有很大的幫助。,"The teacher hopes to train us to convert the interpretation from obscure to easy-to-understand, and also cultivate our reading comprehension ability. It is also easier to prepare for the mid-term oral exam this semester (perhaps because of the experience of the previous semester and the experience of this semester. Most of the content is biased towards practical application, which is better to play), this semester is based on Shizi as the teaching background, but what I want to bring out is the truth behind it and how the judges think and judge (Yanjing often puts the seemingly distant The concept of the concept, brought close to the examples around our lives, is of great help to our understanding.",493,399,0,1,0.9556820392608643

630cf1c240e337e60fce164b,老師人很好上課也非常認真，但上課考試範圍真的太大了⋯導致除了上課時間以外還要自己花很多時間看影片，可以理解想讓我們學更多，但負擔真的不小,"The teachers are very nice and serious in the class, but the scope of the exam is really too big...

I feel that the weight of stuffing in two semesters is a bit too much, and it is difficult to read a lot to read deeply.

630cf1c340e337e60fce177d,老師是我上過所有課裡面，把遠距課程做得最接近實體課程的！就算是遠距但也還使有很好的學習品質！但是因為是線上上課，老師平常上課的時候會用一些代名詞，譬如「那個」、「他們」這些，遠距上課的時候因為老師不會直接指著內容，所以會不太知道老師在講什麼，但除了這個之外真的是一堂非常棒的課程！,"The teacher is the one who makes distance courses the closest to physical courses among all the courses I have taken! Even if it is a long distance, it still has a very good learning quality! But because it is an online class, the teacher usually uses some pronouns in class, such as ""that"" and ""they"". In the remote class, the teacher will not directly point to the content, so I don't know what the teacher is talking about. But other than that a really great class!",308,390,0,3,0.9894213676452637

630cf1c340e337e60fce18e3,若謂民法總則是民法的底基，則民法債總可說是民法學科的大基柱，而葉老師利用一學期的時間，一步步地幫同學們修砌這根基柱，更額外補充了豐富的學說、實務見解，以及程序法、甚至別科的法理來補強、加固，使這根債總的基柱得以建成，若用心認真學習，相信未來在民法的學習上，定能平步青雲。另外，葉老師非常的幽默風趣，會在課餘分享自己的生活趣事及人生經歷，讓大家能夠適時放鬆，我自己也聽的很入迷。葉老師真是位教學認真、人又好的老師，也非常感謝認真的助教們，為同學進行課輔，幫助大家順利通過考試。,"If the general civil law is the foundation of civil law, then the civil law debt can be said to be the main pillar of the civil law subject. Teacher Ye used one semester to help students build this foundation step by step, and added a rich Theories, practical insights, procedural law, and even other disciplines are used to reinforce and strengthen the foundation of this debtor. If you study hard, I believe that in the future, you will be able to make great progress in the study of civil law. In addition, Ms. Ye is very humorous, and she will share her life anecdotes and life experiences after class, so that everyone can relax in time, and I am fascinated by listening to it myself.

630cf1c340e337e60fce18fa,很仔細讀文本，會針對容易混淆的地方解釋，延伸一些可能的爭議讓文本的意義更清楚。 老師很鼓勵問問題，也會耐心回答，上課氣氛輕鬆，不會覺得有壓力。,"Read the text very carefully, explain the confusing places, and extend some possible disputes to make the meaning of the text clearer.

630cf1c340e337e60fce193e,1. 我認為每周的導讀的確能讓同學了解更多議題，但是報告前才抽出報告者的做法我真的非常不解，先不說到底有多少人是來蹭分數的，這樣的做法是不是認定準備上台報告完全不需要多少時間，或是老師覺得我們應該把上台前的所有時間花在準備報告上？同樣，期末報告採用這樣的做法也造成我們小組很多困擾。 2. 我認為研究報告的進度排程太過理想，老師沒有考慮到研究中可能會遇到的一些困難，像是研究題目確定、找受訪者、問卷回收狀況不佳等，也忽略了小組作業需要一定時間來整合，尤其是訪談分析的部分。,"1. I think that the weekly reading guide can indeed help students understand more topics, but I am really puzzled by the practice of selecting speakers before the report. Didn't you think that preparing for the report does not take much time at all, or the teacher thinks that we should spend all the time before going on stage to prepare the report? Similarly, the use of such an approach in the end-of-term report also caused a lot of trouble for our group. 2. I think the schedule of the research report is too ideal. The teacher did not consider some difficulties that may be encountered in the research, such as the determination of the research topic, finding the interviewees, poor return of the questionnaire, etc., and also ignored the group The homework takes time to integrate, especially the interview analysis part.",496,403,0,1,0.0005195736885070801
630cf1c340e337e60fce1932,老師在講課上很清楚，但覺得在課程安排的部分，期中後才和老師討論研究報告對於後續的資料搜集和分析來說有點太趕。,"The teacher was very clear in the lectures, but felt that in the part of the course arrangement, discussing the research report with the teacher after the midterm was a bit too rushed for the subsequent data collection and analysis.",496,403,0,1,0.0006918907165527344

630cf1c240e337e60fce16a2,實體超讚，但遠距用ppt效果欠佳，有點難掌握重點。建議老師可以買平板，這樣遠距就依然可以畫示意圖了。,"The entity is awesome, but the effect of remote ppt is not good, and it is a bit difficult to grasp the key points.

630cf1c240e337e60fce162f,雖然文本都不算太難，但幾乎每週都要導讀還是有點負擔......而且只有兩節課，感覺課程時間可以分配得更好,"Although the texts are not too difficult, it is still a bit of a burden to read the guide almost every week... and there are only two classes, I feel that the course time can be allocated better",955,372,0,3,0.0017679333686828613

630cf1c240e337e60fce1647,我太喜歡麗香老師了，在課程上補充很多筆記及日本道地用法，讓我們除了語言學習，對於日本的文化及習俗也更加熟悉，也引起我想去日本交換的動機，喜歡老師鼓勵同學發言，也給予同學很朵信心開口講日語，可惜遠距課程同學不像實體課程時踴躍發言，讓老師花較多時間在點同學發言哭哭。 雖然這學期課程緊湊許多，考試範圍也增加不少，但從中真的收穫很多，希望老師往後能夠繼續教大學日文三、四，拜託！,"I like Teacher Lixiang very much. He added a lot of notes and authentic Japanese usage in the course, which made us more familiar with Japanese culture and customs in addition to language learning. It also aroused my motivation to go to Japan for exchange. I like the teacher who encourages students to speak , It also gave the students a lot of confidence to speak Japanese. Unfortunately, the students in the distance courses are not as enthusiastic as they are in the physical courses, so the teacher spends more time talking to the students and crying.

Although the seats in the class are the same as those of elementary school students, the instructors are good.

630cf1c240e337e60fce16a3,我認為能先提供申論題題目比較好，不一定只給5題，可以給10題再從其中抽考。,"I think it is better to provide the topic of the application first, not necessarily only 5 questions, but 10 questions and then take a test from them.",935,391,0,1,0.0017723441123962402

630cf1c340e337e60fce1828,收穫很多，所學都應用在社團與所屬組織和專案上，但因為小組不熟識，課後作業效益不大，可能可以有更好的方式促進大家團隊合作和思考。,"I have gained a lot, and what I have learned is applied to the clubs, organizations and projects I belong to. However, because the group is not familiar with it, the homework after class is not very effective. There may be better ways to promote teamwork and thinking.",9,400,0,1,0.00026482343673706055

Thank you teacher, you have worked hard this semester! I also thank the teacher for not having a final exam this semester. I will not be like other teachers who have no time and insist on taking the exam, which will burden the students too much. The teacher praises it.",947,727,0,1,0.9994484782218933
630cf1c340e337e60fce18a8,學期初陳老師的教學很淺白易懂，步調上也配合學生吸收速度，這個時候是上課認真聽、作業就基本上會寫，讓我感受到成就感。第二階段莊老師的講解易懂，只是有時候我們對該新概念很陌生，需要講個兩次利於我們思考吸收，整體來說讚讚。各種最佳化模型跟廣告投放的機制很有趣，謝謝老師們這學期的指導。,"At the beginning of the semester, Teacher Chen’s teaching is very simple and easy to understand, and the pace is also in line with the students’ absorption speed. At this time, I listen carefully in class and can basically write homework, which makes me feel a sense of accomplishment. In the second stage, Mr. Zhuang’s explanations are easy to understand, but sometimes we are very unfamiliar with this new concept, and we need to talk about it twice to facilitate our thinking and absorption. Overall, we praise it. The various optimization models and advertising mechanisms are very interesting. Thank you teachers for your guidance this semester.",678,427,3,1,0.9995310306549072
630cf1c340e337e60fce18db,我喜歡老師的表達方式，不會太過枯燥乏味但又能很好理解書本裡的知識,"I like the teacher's way of expression, it is not too boring but can understand the knowledge in the book well",920,724,0,1,0.9992451667785645

630cf1c340e337e60fce18cc,老師在授課時雖然較多嚴肅，但偶爾也會說說幽默輕鬆的事，私下老師在處理學生問題時很和善。想建議老師在學期初/期中以前就能告知期末團體與個人報告的繳交與報告期限，不然實在有些措手不及⋯。謝謝老師！,"Although the teacher is more serious when teaching, he occasionally talks about humorous and light-hearted things. In private, the teacher is very kind when dealing with students' problems. I would like to suggest that the teacher can inform the due date of the final group and individual reports and report deadlines before the beginning/mid-term of the semester, otherwise I will be caught off guard....

630cf1c340e337e60fce18ac,很喜歡這堂體育課，是我所有上過的體育課中最有趣的。當初知道這個體育活動是因為我知道它在日本好像蠻熱門便想試試看，完全超出預期的有趣，最喜歡在台大的定向，發現那個校園真的很漂亮。謝謝老師這學期的教導，也感受得到老師對這項運動很有熱情，認真地想要推廣。如果要給建議的話，那我會希望可以多一些學校周邊社區的定向，在政大有點缺少樂趣。,"I really like this PE class, it is the most interesting of all the PE classes I have ever taken. At the beginning, I knew about this sport because I knew it seemed to be quite popular in Japan, so I wanted to try it out. It was more interesting than expected. I like the orientation at National Taiwan University the most, and I found that the campus is really beautiful. Thank you teacher for teaching this semester. I also feel that the teacher is very enthusiastic about this sport and wants to promote it seriously. If I want to give advice, then I would like to have more orientation on the surrounding communities of the school. It is a bit lacking in fun at National Chengchi University.",511,414,0,1,0.9906700849533081
630cf1c340e337e60fce18da,老師上課總是帶著淺淺的笑意，談論起自己從事實務的往事更是英姿瀟灑，讓人不禁產生欽佩之情，期待日後還有機會選到老師的課！！＞＜,"The teacher always has a slight smile in the class, and he is even more heroic when talking about his past practice, which makes people feel admiration.

630cf1c340e337e60fce18ee,老師超級幽默，即使是下午的課也不容易恍神打瞌睡。上課內容也非常扎實，受益良多。唯一的小建議是希望老師的語速可以放慢一點點。,"The teacher is super humorous, and it is not easy to doze off even in the afternoon class. The content of the class is also very solid and I have benefited a lot. The only small suggestion is that I hope the teacher's speaking speed can be slowed down a little.",920,724,0,1,0.9996829032897949
630cf1c340e337e60fce1941,老師這學期有調整小考方式，都是上課會講解題目跟詳解下課直接填寫所以不會壓力很大，還是希望上課可以多講解一些題目,"The teacher has adjusted the way of the quiz this semester. They will explain the questions in class and fill in the detailed explanations after class, so there will be no pressure. I still hope that I can explain more questions in class",99,725,3,1,0.9955652356147766
630cf1c340e337e60fce18e6,我覺得啓洲老師的債總真的上的很用心，講義的編排很清楚明暸，而且課程中也會穿插一些有趣的故事或經歷，可以有喘口氣的時間～在講解課程時也會由淺入深。最最最重要的是，老師講完一些複雜的概念在課程最後都會給我們鼓勵XD每次上完三小時覺得自己笨蛋的時候，都會被救贖，真的很感謝老師。,"I think Mr. Qizhou’s debts are really attentive, the arrangement of the lecture notes is very clear, and some interesting stories or experiences will be interspersed in the course, so that you can have time to take a breath~ When explaining the course, it will also be shallow into the depths. The most important thing is that the teacher will encourage us at the end of the course after explaining some complicated concepts. XD Every time I feel stupid after three hours of class, I will be saved. I am really grateful to the teacher.",920,724,0,1,0.9930237531661987
630cf1c340e337e60fce18ef,老師上課內容相當有趣，但要花時間好好消化。如果老師上課語速可以再慢一點會更好。,"The content of the teacher's class is quite interesting, but it takes time to digest it. It would be better if the teacher could speak more slowly in class.",920,724,0,1,0.0018796324729919434

630cf1c340e337e60fce198a,老師很親切，上課會分享對外考試常出的考題，非常實用。文法也上的深入淺出，感覺的到老師很擅長整理重點，唯二需要改善的是上課進度希望能快一些，以及希望老師能更熟練操作遠距軟體。,"The teacher is very kind. In class, he will share frequently asked questions in foreign exams, which is very practical. Grammar is also easy to understand, and I feel that the teacher is very good at sorting out the key points. The only thing that needs to be improved is that the progress of the class should be faster, and the teacher can be more proficient in operating remote software.",343,418,2,1,0.9553983807563782
630cf1c240e337e60fce1697,希望針對期末報告和作業可以在繳交的前一堂課前，再次做明確說明,I hope that the end-of-term report and homework can be clearly explained again before the previous class that is handed in,934,393,0,3,0.28356003761291504

630cf1c240e337e60fce16c9,我覺得老師教得很好 教學用心 也總是很熱心回答學生提出的問題 但希望可以不要用Kahoot! 作為評分標準之一 有時候上課的東西還來不及吸收就要做成效測驗 讓人感到有點壓力 也擔心自己的成績因此被影響,"I think the teacher teaches very well and is always eager to answer the questions raised by the students, but I hope that Kahoot can be used as one of the scoring criteria Worried that your grades will be affected by this",764,416,3,1,0.005112826824188232

630cf1c240e337e60fce1733,希望老師可以多呈現一些真實企業在使用的統計學範例，而非只是照著課本教學，因為課本中的範例多為美國市場為主，與台灣當地市場較不貼切,"I hope the teacher can present more examples of statistics used by real companies instead of just teaching according to the textbooks, because the examples in the textbooks are mainly for the US market, which is not suitable for the local market in Taiwan",792,392,0,1,0.0006074905395507812

630cf1c340e337e60fce187f,在提案發想的過程非常茫然也不斷撞牆，不過老師樂於對同學的提案提供建議，讓我們對金融科技創新發想提供不同觀點。 是門讓人挑戰挫折忍耐力跟團隊協作的課程!,"In the process of making proposals, I was at a loss and kept hitting the wall, but the teacher was willing to provide suggestions on the proposals of the students, allowing us to provide different perspectives on financial technology innovation.

630cf1c340e337e60fce1931,希望老師與助教可以增加與各組研究計畫的交流與指導，僅有五月答辯可以知道計畫的方向是否正確，先前的作業似乎只是在確保我們有在進行研究，沒有給予作業的具體評析，僅針對格式等進行說明，無法了解研究計畫的方向是否可行有無需要調整。另外，由於答辯是各自進行，各組之間不會有交流，其實還滿需要透過了解各組的狀況來理解所謂的研究可以以及可能有什麼樣的主題和進行方式。,"I hope that teachers and teaching assistants can increase communication and guidance with each group of research projects. Only the defense in May can know whether the direction of the project is correct. The previous assignments seem to be just to ensure that we are conducting research without giving specific comments on the assignments. , only to explain the format, etc., it is impossible to know whether the direction of the research plan is feasible or needs to be adjusted.

Thank you teacher for this semester. It is very good to consider students’ loading and delete the exam, and I am willing to provide assistance to students with research problems. It’s just a pity that there is no class like last semester.

Frankly speaking, the statistics taught by the Academy of Social Sciences are much more solid than this class, and relatively speaking, this class is a standard sweet and cool class. In class, there is no need to keep clicking on students to read the words on the briefing. I don't quite understand the meaning of pointing students to read aloud.

The pictures drawn by decomposing the topics in class are also very useful! Moreover, the teacher's lively and interesting lectures, coupled with convincing personal opinions, are all admirable.

630cf1c340e337e60fce1922,給分很不錯。 有隨機分組的報告要做，但不是太困難的題目。 定向測驗那天是下雨天，因為要在校園裡到處跑，建議穿得比較輕便。 校外參訪從兩個地點擇一，從學校出發大概花公車兩小時來回的時間，當作偶爾出門玩差不多，但卡到其他堂課的話，可能不太不方便，不過老師也有開假日場次給同學報名。,"Very good points. There are randomization reports to be made, but not too difficult topics. It was raining on the day of the orientation test, so it is recommended to wear light clothes because you will be running around the campus. Choose one of the two places for off-campus visits.

630cf1c340e337e60fce1938,這學期上課內容不多，我覺得可以把多的時間拿去給小組討論或是寫作業。我覺得老師可以要我們讀書寫紙本報告，但是要在課堂上花40分鐘介紹一本書，很浪費時間。一來是因為整本書的內容太廣，二來是同學的表達能力不一定夠好，三來要聽同學平板且表達不一定流暢的介紹40分鐘真的太長，大部分同學真的很難專注吸收。還不如把多的時間拿來討論期末報告，老師可以要求每堂課結束之後報告要到什麼進度，並在大家討論的時候依組別順序到各組協助討論。如果真要報告書本，就縮短報告時間並著墨在研究法的相關內容上就好。,"There is not much class content this semester, and I think I can devote more time to group discussions or homework. I think teachers can ask us to read and write paper reports, but it is a waste of time to spend 40 minutes introducing a book in class. Firstly, because the content of the whole book is too broad, secondly, the expressive ability of the students may not be good enough, and thirdly, it is really too long to listen to the introductions given by the classmates with flat and not smooth expressions, and it is really difficult for most of the students. Focus on absorbing. It is better to spend more time discussing the end-of-term report. The teacher can ask for a report on the progress to be made after the end of each class, and assist in the discussion in each group according to the order of the group during the discussion. If you really want to report on the book, just shorten the report time and focus on the relevant content of the research method.",496,403,0,1,0.0003008842468261719
630cf1c340e337e60fce1799,這堂課採用非同步遠距跟實體交錯的上課方式，但是非同步遠距的週都只是把教材(只有一次是不到一小時的教學錄影，剩下都是文字與圖片教材)丟上來讓同學自己讀就沒了，而且實體教學的週教的還是之前丟上來的教材，等於只上了半學期的課，但又有很多作業。 excel的實體課教得還不錯，但是只教了一點就要我們做期中報告實在感覺不好，access幾乎只教了打開檔案而已，結果在這堂課學到的東西真的很少。,"This class adopts asynchronous distance and physical interleaving teaching methods, but the asynchronous distance week only throws the teaching materials (only one time is less than an hour of teaching video, and the rest are text and picture teaching materials) The students were gone after reading it by themselves, and Zhou, who taught in the physical teaching, still taught the textbooks thrown up before, which meant that he had only attended half a semester of class, but he had a lot of homework. The entity class of excel is not bad, but it feels bad to ask us to do a mid-term report after only a little bit of teaching.

Maybe for some students, the progress of the course is slow, but I think that in terms of language courses, if you don't first arouse students' curiosity to learn, it will be difficult to stick to it later. . But because of the teacher's inspiration, I am also learning Japanese with addition and subtraction. I hope that I can take the Japanese test after a while. I really like the way the teacher teaches!

Some students could not choose the previous day because they had other exams or reports, etc. As a result, the teacher's tone became a bit bad. We know that the teacher wants to balance the number of people taking the exam in two days. After all, it is not convenient for the teacher to have too many people in one day. But on the contrary, I also hope that the teacher can understand that we didn't mean to be lazy, and we really couldn't take the exam on the same day.",5,382,1,1,0.011051297187805176
630cf1c240e337e60fce169f,謝謝老師把西哲史這麼龐雜的系統跟內容做很清楚的說明。之前在實體課時，雖然可以跟著老師在課堂上做筆記，但是翻書時會覺得內容比授課的內容還要深，這是我覺得跟線上課相比較美中不足的地方。因為時間跟篇幅的關係，有時候還是會期待老師能帶我們進行哲學家文本的閱讀，會想聽老師做一些關於文本本身的分析。,"Thank you teacher for explaining such a complex system and content of Xi Zhe Shi very clearly. In the physical class before, although I could follow the teacher to take notes in class, but when I flipped through the book, I felt that the content was deeper than the content of the lecture. This is what I think is a fly in the ointment compared with online classes. Because of the relationship between time and length, sometimes I still expect the teacher to take us to read philosophers' texts, and I want to hear the teacher do some analysis on the text itself.",935,391,0,1,0.10977774858474731

For the failure to do well in the movements, he did not give private guidance, but asked the students to demonstrate their mistakes in front of the whole class and then wash their faces in public.

630cf1c340e337e60fce18fb,老師很認真，也很樂於幫忙學生解決問題，並鼓勵學生討論。老師人很好都不會因為回答的程度有差異而指責，都還是會很鼓勵學生。,"The teacher is serious and willing to help students solve problems and encourage students to discuss.

630cf1c340e337e60fce1a1c,老師上課還會結合程式，教我們用程式畫出微積分的圖，除了新奇外也幫助我們更了解微積分的用意，另外每周小考也讓我更了解上課內容並檢視自己有沒有真的學會。,"The teacher will also combine programs in class, teaching us to use programs to draw calculus diagrams. In addition to being novel, it also helps us understand the purpose of calculus better. In addition, the weekly quiz also allows me to better understand the content of the class and check whether I have really learned it.",197,432,0,1,0.9964025020599365
630cf1c340e337e60fce19cc,雖然理解老師的難處，但課程進度實在是太快了。非同步的課程內容可以重複播放，相較之下比較好吸收一點。,"Although I understand the teacher's difficulties, the progress of the course is too fast. Asynchronous course content can be played repeatedly, which is easier to absorb.",323,420,0,1,0.0017098784446716309
630cf1c340e337e60fce1a21,我覺得老師應該要幫同學勾一下課本習題，因為課本習題太多，常常做不完，也不知道哪個是重要的！就教學而言，老師的引導跟流暢度很棒，口齒也很清晰，算是教的很好的一位老師，如果老師能有自編的講義，就無懈可擊了。,"I think the teacher should help the students tick off the exercises in the textbooks, because there are too many exercises in the textbooks, and it is often impossible to finish them, and I don’t know which ones are important!

630cf1c340e337e60fce19ac,下學期有幸選到老師的課，真的是非常開心。老師真的很可愛，也常常分享一些實務界的小故事，而不只是一昧地敘述教科書或學理上的概念，能更加深我對於債總條文操作的概念！唯一可惜的地方是老師上課講話真的講好快，而且句句箴言，有時候會跟不上老師的思維，但很感謝老師有提供錄影檔供我們參考！,"I am very happy to be lucky enough to be selected for the teacher's class next semester. The teacher is really cute, and often shares some short stories from the practical world, instead of just narrating textbooks or academic concepts, it can deepen my concept of the operation of debt clauses! The only pity is that the teacher speaks really fast in class, and sometimes he can't keep up with the teacher's thinking, but I am very grateful to the teacher for providing the video file for our reference!",920,417,0,1,0.9992715716362

630cf1c340e337e60fce1978,希望老師能在更加強助教課的品質~下學期的總經時常聽完老師的課後還不是很懂，需要助教課時再加強一些觀念跟講解，所以助教課的內容若能再詳細一些，多解釋本章重要觀念，為學生統整、加深印象的話我覺得學習的效果會更加。也希望助教課的資料跟上課方式能有系統一些，有的時候放在moodle 有時候在youtube有時候又放在雲端真的很混亂... 老師這學期辛苦了!除了助教課還能再更好之外，整體來說很喜歡老師的課，實體時課堂的互動很有趣~,"I hope the teacher can strengthen the quality of the teaching assistant class~ In the next semester, the general manager often doesn’t understand the teacher’s class after listening to the teacher’s class. It is necessary to strengthen some concepts and explanations during the teaching assistant class, so if the content of the teaching assistant class can be more detailed, more If I explain the important concepts of this chapter and consolidate and deepen the impression for students, I think the learning effect will be more effective. I also hope that the information of the teaching assistant class can be more systematic with the way of teaching. Sometimes it is placed on moodle, sometimes on youtube, and sometimes on the cloud. Other than that, overall, I like the teacher's class very much. The interaction in the classroom is very interesting~",99,401,0,1,0.9760165810585022

630cf1c340e337e60fce19b6,優點是老師考試的題目與評分都算是對同學很友善，上課的時候老師也幽默風趣不無聊，同時教學深度很夠，對於重點地方的補充跟延伸都很足 ，另外就是上課都會錄影很讚，因為老師上課延伸與補充不少也不簡單非常需要重看或按暫停思考 但是對於有些細微的地方就跳躍有點快，複習很費勁，不但要把細節自己讀懂還要連老師上課延伸的都看懂,"The advantage is that the questions and scores of the teacher's exam are very friendly to the students. The teacher is also humorous and not boring during the class. At the same time, the teaching depth is sufficient, and the supplement and extension of the key points are sufficient. In addition, the video recording of the class is very good. Because it is not easy for the teacher to extend and supplement a lot in class, it is very necessary to re-read or pause to think, but for some subtle places, the jump is a bit fast, and the review is very laborious. Not only do you have to understand the details yourself, but you also have to read the teacher’s extended class. Understand",920,417,0,1,0.5513991117477417

630cf1c340e337e60fce19c9,我很喜歡老師上課時會分享許多自己去日本留學時的旅遊經驗，並透過文這些日本地方特色和文化習俗結合課程內容，除了課本制式化的學習外還能更了解我們正在學習的語言背後真正的用意，我覺得是一件非常有趣且非常有意義的事。不過老師有的時候會講得太起勁，導致正課來不及上完而必須用趕課的方式，對於像我一樣程度較差的學生可能負荷有點大，若是可以更妥善的安排授課進度或許對於學生的學習會有更大的助益！另外，老師的考試真的好難，希望老師期末可以出簡單一點，不然我真的會被當掉的...,"I really like that the teacher will share a lot of his travel experience when he went to Japan to study in class, and through these Japanese local characteristics and cultural customs combined with the course content, in addition to the standard study of textbooks, we can better understand the real behind the language we are learning. I think it is a very interesting and meaningful thing. However, the teacher sometimes speaks too vigorously, causing the class to be too late to finish and must use the method of catching up. The load may be a bit heavy for students with poorer levels like me. If the teaching progress can be arranged more properly, it may affect the students' learning. There will be greater help! In addition, the teacher's exam is really difficult. I hope the teacher can make it easier at the end of the semester, otherwise I will really be dismissed...",323,420,0,1,0.011468648910522461
630cf1c340e337e60fce1971,很謝謝老師都會出題目讓我們更理解如何應用所學的知識! 然後很喜歡聽老師分享兒子跟倉鼠XD,I am very grateful to the teacher for always asking questions so that we can better understand how to apply the knowledge we have learned!

630cf1c340e337e60fce19a8,個人覺得課後複習的影音檔非常受用，需要課後再針對不清楚的地方複習。 此外，希望老師可以把債總講義都先上傳，這樣方便一次列印做成書本。 謝謝葉老師，您的論述能力與口條很強，講義內容編排很豐富，但希望前面可以加上一些體系性的介紹。,"Personally, I think the audio-visual files reviewed after class are very useful, and I need to review the unclear points after class. In addition, I hope that the teacher can upload all the debt lectures first, so that it can be printed and made into a book at one time. Thank you, Teacher Ye, your exposition ability and eloquence are very strong, and the content of the lecture notes is very rich, but I hope you can add some systematic introductions in front.",920,417,0,1,0.9996651411056519
630cf1c340e337e60fce19cb,我覺得課後補充或許可以考慮變成電子檔的，比較不會產生印太多浪費紙張的情況,"I think after-school supplements may be considered to be electronic files, and it is less likely to cause too much waste of paper.",323,420,0,1,0.0005324482917785645

630cf1c340e337e60fce19d1,非常喜歡老師的初日課！雖然期中考實在是有點不人道，但受益良多，相信對於往後的日語學習會有很大幫助。,"I really like the teacher's first day class! Although the midterm exam is a bit inhumane, it has benefited a lot and I believe it will be of great help to the future Japanese learning.",323,420,0,1,0.9997383952140808

630cf1c340e337e60fce1962,每個禮拜的預錄課程影片，讓很多不懂的概念可以不斷重複播放，有助於讓學生了解學習內容，影片也有分段，可以讓學生看一個段落先消化一下再繼續其他的課程內容。實體的習題講解若沒有事先看題目，直接到現場上課會很吃力。,"The pre-recorded course videos every week allow many concepts that are not understood to be played repeatedly, which helps students understand the learning content. The videos are also segmented, allowing students to watch a paragraph and digest it before continuing with other course content.

630cf1c340e337e60fce1929,本學期老師安排的報告太多，導致我整個學期都覺得在聽報告，反而能聽老師講課的部分不多。希望老師下次可以減少讓同學報告的部分，能用問題討論來代替，如此更能有效運用所學到的東西，而不是只報告課本已有的內容。,"There are too many reports arranged by the teacher this semester, which makes me feel that I am listening to the reports throughout the semester, but there are not many parts that I can listen to the teacher's lectures. I hope that the teacher can reduce the part of the students' report next time and replace it with problem discussions, so that they can use what they have learned more effectively, instead of just reporting what is already in the textbook.",9,404,0,1,0.0035530924797058105

630cf1c340e337e60fce19ba,我覺得啓洲老師的債總真的上的很用心，講義的編排很清楚明暸，而且課程中也會穿插一些有趣的故事或經歷，可以有喘口氣的時間～在講解課程時也會由淺入深。最最最重要的是，老師講完一些複雜的概念在課程最後都會給我們鼓勵XD每次上完三小時覺得自己笨蛋的時候，都會被救贖，真的很感謝老師。,"I think Mr. Qizhou’s debts are really attentive, the arrangement of the lecture notes is very clear, and some interesting stories or experiences will be interspersed in the course, so that you can have time to take a breath~ When explaining the course, it will also be shallow into the depths. The most important thing is that the teacher will encourage us at the end of the course after explaining some complicated concepts. XD Every time I feel stupid after three hours of class, I will be saved. I am really grateful to the teacher.",920,417,0,1,0.9930237531661987

630cf1c340e337e60fce19c5,上課時很常發現自己會跟不上老師再講的地方，不只一次回過頭來才發現自己看的地方跟老師完全不一樣，我覺得這是實體課比較困擾的地方,"In class, I often find that I can’t keep up with what the teacher is talking about. More than once, when I look back, I find that what I’m looking at is completely different from the teacher’s.

630cf1c340e337e60fce1976,預錄影片上課，對於較困難或不熟悉的觀念可以回去複習，學習起來效率較好。實體上課時，老師會準備問題讓大家自由回答加分，講解時速度有點快，預習後再去聽課效果較好。期中考有難度，平常要跟緊課程和多練習題目。,"Pre-recorded videos for class, you can go back and review more difficult or unfamiliar concepts, and the learning efficiency is better. In the physical class, the teacher will prepare questions for everyone to answer freely for extra points. The speed of explanation is a bit fast, and it is better to go to the class after previewing. The mid-term exam is difficult, and you usually have to follow the courses closely and practice more questions.",99,401,0,1,0.011687219142913818
630cf1c340e337e60fce195d,胡老師的經濟學每個禮拜的份量都不少，雖然負擔稍大，但確實幫助我更自主的學習經濟學相關知識，複習也更到位。謝謝老師每個禮拜都不辭辛勞的錄製講解影片。,"Mr. Hu's economics has a lot of weight every week. Although the burden is a bit heavy, it does help me learn economics-related knowledge more independently, and the review is more in place.

630cf1c340e337e60fce19bf,我覺得老師整理的體系圖很能讓人了解那堂課的重點！上課分解題目畫的圖也很好用！而且老師能夠生動有趣的講課，再加上很有說服力的個人見解，都令人佩服。不過，我覺得老師上課的時候容易在講義的每一頁跳來跳去，不過在遠距後搭配螢幕分享整個問題都解決了！,"I think the system diagram compiled by the teacher can make people understand the key points of that class! The pictures drawn by decomposing the topics in class are also very useful! Moreover, the teacher's lively and interesting lectures, coupled with convincing personal opinions, are all admirable. However, I think the teacher tends to jump around every page of the handouts during the class, but the whole problem is solved with screen sharing after a long distance!",920,417,0,1,0.9965053796768188

I was at a loss about the economy at first, and I often didn’t understand many concepts and nouns when reading news or articles. Now I understand it in general, and sometimes I can even analyze it from my own perspective. I feel very happy. I have benefited a lot from this class. I also thank the teacher for applying the classroom knowledge to current affairs in a simple way. I had no idea about the future, but I am very happy to take this class, which made me decide to put the subject of economics in my life plan!",99,401,0,1,0.9993502497673035
630cf1c340e337e60fce1967,老師提供加分題使同學有額外機會來提高自身分數，覺得老師及助教皆非常用心。,The teacher provides bonus questions so that students have extra opportunities to improve their scores. I feel that the teachers and teaching assistants are very attentive.,99,401,0,1,0.9883220791816711
630cf1c340e337e60fce19c7,老師講話真的很有趣，教得也很紮實。偶爾出現的模仿秀也很好笑👍但我覺得考試真滴頗難對於上大學才開始學日文的人就算我每週念爆還是考的比很多本來日文就很好的人爛很多🥲可以像上學期一樣出120分就太好了🫠初學者信心真的會被期中打擊得很慘哭啊,"The teacher's speech is really interesting and the teaching is very solid. The occasional imitation show is also very funny👍 But I think the exam is really difficult. For those who just started learning Japanese in college, even if I read it every week, I still do a lot worse than many people who are good at Japanese.

630cf1c340e337e60fce1a53,希望老師能在實作前講一些相關理論知識，不然直接開始操作感覺有點難盡速狀況,"I hope the teacher can explain some relevant theoretical knowledge before the implementation, otherwise it will be a bit difficult to start the operation directly.",958,430,0,2,0.00028187036514282227
630cf1c340e337e60fce1968,老師上課很有趣，也都聽得懂，但是考試範圍跟其他經濟學老師比起來會有點多 沒有甚麼作業很讚，也會有給同學加分題的機會,"The teacher's class is very interesting and understandable, but the scope of the test is a bit more compared with other economics teachers. There is no homework that is very good, and there will be opportunities for students to give extra points to the questions",99,401,0,1,0.15166962146759033
630cf1c340e337e60fce1969,老師這學期教的比上學期還要好，只要影片有認真看完、有好好複習基本上考試不會太難，小考超佛只有五題單選，加分題有點難但助教都會盡力協助，寫錯了還是可以加分，推推！,"The teacher’s teaching this semester is even better than last semester. As long as you have watched the film carefully and reviewed it well, the exam will not be too difficult. The quiz Chaofo only has five multiple-choice questions.

630cf1c340e337e60fce19b7,若謂民法總則是民法的底基，則民法債總可說是民法學科的大基柱，而葉老師利用一學期的時間，一步步地幫同學們修砌這根基柱，更額外補充了豐富的學說、實務見解，以及程序法、甚至別科的法理來補強、加固，使這根債總的基柱得以建成，若用心認真學習，相信未來在民法的學習上，定能平步青雲。另外，葉老師非常的幽默風趣，會在課餘分享自己的生活趣事及人生經歷，讓大家能夠適時放鬆，我自己也聽的很入迷。葉老師真是位教學認真、人又好的老師，也非常感謝認真的助教們，為同學進行課輔，幫助大家順利通過考試。,"If the general civil law is the foundation of civil law, then the civil law debt can be said to be the main pillar of the civil law subject.

630cf1c340e337e60fce1a50,既然課程是「初級」女籃，希望老師能夠在教課時更加考量無基礎學生的學習情形，而不是站在自己的立場覺得很簡單很基本大家就應該都會。我自己本身在籃球上並沒有基礎，常常老師上課時還沒學會一個動作就換下一個了，期中和期末項目對我而言也有些吃力，但老師評分合理上課氣氛融洽，因此我還是非常喜歡這堂課。,"Since the course is ""beginner"" women's basketball, I hope that the teacher can give more consideration to the learning situation of students with no foundation when teaching the class, instead of standing on their own standpoint and thinking that it is very simple and basic, and everyone should know it. I myself don’t have a foundation in basketball, and the teacher often changes a move before he has learned it in class. The mid-term and final projects are also a bit difficult for me, but the teacher’s grades are reasonable and the class atmosphere is harmonious, so I still like it very much. this class.",525,421,0,1,0.9819669723510742
630cf1c340e337e60fce1a8a,希望老師能尊重期末考投票的結果，既然超過一半以上的人投取消考試，就應該要尊重學生意見!  至於其他課程內容的部分，老師時常鼓勵同學獨立思考，也很喜歡每週課堂的國際新聞分享，除了可以透過老師提供的不同視角切入看事情之外，還可以聽聽同學的不同的想法、觀點。老師上課很有趣、不無聊，跟同學互動也很多。總而言之，是很推薦上的一門課!,"I hope the teacher can respect the results of the final exam vote. Since more than half of the people voted to cancel the exam, students’ opinions should be respected! As for other course content, the teacher often encourages students to think independently, and I also like the international news in the classroom every week. Sharing, in addition to looking at things through the different perspectives provided by the teacher, you can also listen to the different ideas and opinions of your classmates. The teacher's class is very interesting, not boring, and there is a lot of interaction with the students. All in all, a highly recommended course!",151,431,0,1,0.9995802044868469

630cf1c340e337e60fce1a9e,謝謝老師這學期的教導！我收穫良多，學到很多有架構的人力資源知識，還有一些實務上的認識，我覺得有搭配課外閱讀和個案還有老師上課的一些實務經驗的分享很有助於學習人資相關知識，也讓我更知道該如何應用！,"Thank you teacher for teaching this semester! I have gained a lot, learned a lot of structured human resources knowledge, and some practical knowledge.

630cf1c340e337e60fce1a87,謝謝老師的教學，實體上課時運動量十分充足，也學到許多技巧。不過對籃球初學者、運動能力沒那麼好的人來說，考試內容蠻難的，且教學內容每週都有新的部分，或許可以隔兩週再增加新的動作，以利較完善的學習。,"Thank you teacher for your teaching. During the physical class, I exercised a lot and learned a lot of skills. However, for basketball beginners and those with less athletic ability, the test content is quite difficult, and there are new parts of the teaching content every week, and new movements may be added every two weeks to facilitate more complete learning .",525,421,0,1,0.012595772743225098

I hope that the teacher will not take up the class and leave the class. It doesn’t matter if the class is not finished, because it is studying, and it is a waste of time to call the class. up.",961,730,0,2,0.0002307295799255371

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b2b,老師人很好很關心學生，課程很紮實，但希望可以準時上下課QQ遠距之後有幾次多上了十分鐘。,"The teachers are very nice and caring about the students, and the courses are very solid, but I hope that I can start and leave classes on time. After QQ remote distance, there are times when I take ten minutes longer.",5,450,1,1,0.9986869692802429
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b0e,希望老師可以對課程負責，不要因為每次都公司忙就不來上課，或臨時更改上課方式。,"I hope that the teacher can be responsible for the course, and don't stop coming to class every time because the company is busy, or temporarily change the way of class.",962,731,0,3,0.9533545970916748

630cf1c340e337e60fce1a8f,個人跟老師的風格不太相符，但是基本上老師很用心，還會記得班上幾乎所有的同學。,"Personally and the teacher's style does not match, but basically the teacher is very attentive and remembers almost all the students in the class.",151,431,0,1,0.9991053938865662
630cf1c340e337e60fce1a9b,每周的國際新聞雖然是一項作業，但也讓我每周可以去瀏覽新聞媒體所報導的國際大事。,"Although the weekly international news is an assignment, it also allows me to browse the international events reported by the news media every week.",151,431,0,1,0.9941615462303162

630cf1c340e337e60fce1a83,感覺上課的說詞流程是制式的，例如讓學生做完一趟練習後，常說：「剛剛看你們的動作幾乎都不正確，大概有80%的同學都⋯」，覺得沒有真的看學生情況而做調整。另外，沒有否認老師打球的技巧及專業度，但我認為老師不太會教，介紹的動作要領並沒有真正點到重點，教動作時總是說「就這樣，非常簡單」，雖然可能老師想讓我們心態上不要害怕困難，但常常會覺得被敷衍了一個新動作，練習的時候因不太會而更加感到無力。再來是考試，我認為老師考試的難易度及計分方式很需要調整。,"I feel that the speech process in class is standard. For example, after students finish a practice session, they often say: ""I just saw that your movements are almost incorrect. About 80% of the students are..."", I feel that I have not really looked at the students Adjust according to the situation. In addition, I did not deny the teacher's skills and professionalism in playing ball, but I think the teacher is not very good at teaching, and the essentials of the movements introduced did not really hit the point. When teaching movements, he always said ""that's it, very simple"", although the teacher may want to Let us not be afraid of difficulties in our mentality, but we often feel that we have been perfunctory in a new movement, and we feel more powerless because we are not very good at practicing. Next is the exam. I think the difficulty level and scoring method of the teacher's exam need to be adjusted.",525,421,0,1,0.0009362101554870605

630cf1c340e337e60fce1ac7,感覺老師在實體課上比較有活力，因此我比較喜歡實體課 我覺得考試的題目出得很好，可以確實地讓我去思考哲學如何應用在日常生活當中,"I feel that the teacher is more energetic in the physical class, so I prefer the physical class. I think the exam questions are very good, and it can really make me think about how philosophy is applied in daily life",961,730,0,2,0.9995030164718628

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b2c,老師這學期的教材有系統性，分主題讓同學學習相關內容，我覺得很棒！,"The teacher's teaching materials for this semester are systematic, and the students are divided into topics to learn related content. I think it is great!",5,450,1,1,0.9997920393943787
630cf1c440e337e60fce1af8,寶珠老師超級棒！上課內容很詳細，鼓勵學生發問，回答時也很詳細。上課時也會分享自己的經驗，除了讓課堂不沉悶以外，也讓學生更了解日本當地的生活與文化。 然後老師上學期會先很清楚地教動詞變化，一開始可能會霧煞煞搞不清楚狀況，但到了這學期在開始各種變化後我覺得會更快上手，對學習日文有一定的幫助~,"Teacher Baozhu is great! The class content is very detailed, students are encouraged to ask questions, and the answers are also very detailed. In class, I will also share my own experience. In addition to making the class less boring, it also allows students to better understand the local life and culture in Japan. Then the teacher will teach the verb changes very clearly in the last semester. At the beginning, it may be confusing to understand the situation, but in this semester, after starting various changes, I think it will be easier to get started, and it will be helpful for learning Japanese~",323,418,0,1,0.9993919134140015

630cf1c340e337e60fce1ac3,我認為遠距教學時的點名方式可以再優化，因為點名的方式非常耗時，而且對於在名單中排序較後的同學很不利，基本上就直接失去第一節下課了。,"I think the roll call method during distance teaching can be further optimized, because the roll call method is very time-consuming, and it is not good for students who are ranked lower in the list, basically they will lose the first class directly.",961,730,0,2,0.0002484917640686035
630cf1c340e337e60fce1ac8,遠距教學時的點名方式感覺可以更有效率，也希望老師講述詮釋學時能多以自身觀點闡述內容而非大多限於文本的中譯敘述，不過仍然收穫良多，是很棒的一堂課。,"I feel that the roll call method during distance teaching can be more efficient. I also hope that when the teacher talks about hermeneutics, he can explain the content from his own point of view instead of mostly limited to the Chinese translation of the text. However, he still gained a lot and it was a great class.",961,730,0,2,0.9993951320648193

630cf1c340e337e60fce1a4c,老師教學認真，教授的動作之間有連貫性，也會親自示範動作，能比較容易做出正確的動作。偶爾遇到不熟的動作去詢問老師時，老師也會很有耐心教導，並確認動作的完整性。唯一感到比較不方便的是，因為疫情而採遠距教學，期末拍影片的場地比較不好找，家裡也沒有籃球。,"The teacher is serious in teaching, the movements taught are coherent, and he will also demonstrate the movements in person, making it easier to make correct movements. Occasionally, when you ask the teacher about an unfamiliar movement, the teacher will teach it patiently and confirm the integrity of the movement. The only thing that feels inconvenient is that due to the epidemic, distance learning is adopted, and it is difficult to find a venue for filming at the end of the semester, and there is no basketball at home.",525,421,0,1,0.1348026990890503

In the classroom, students will be asked to read the textbooks in turn and attach great importance to the students' pronunciation.

630cf1c340e337e60fce1a9f,老師對於教學的內容還有課程的掌控很好，仔細想想從老師教學的過程中也能看到許多課上內容的應用。,"The teacher has a good control over the content of the teaching and the courses.

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b02,老師可以多教各種方法背後的數學原理，像是 Adam/SGD等optimizer & RMSProp/Momentum之間的關係等等，另外也可以考慮換個比數學軟體應用更適配的課名！,"Teachers can teach more about the mathematical principles behind various methods, such as the relationship between Adam/SGD and other optimizers & RMSProp/Momentum, etc. In addition, you can also consider changing the title of the course that is more suitable than mathematical software applications!",959,432,0,3,0.765824019908905

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b18,小偉老師的民法概要真的太紮實了，雖然讀起來真的比較吃力，不過總能在小偉老師豐富的經驗講述中，更清晰的了解其概念。如果上課的簡報可以早一點上傳，待修正的地方少一些，那就更棒了！,"Teacher Xiaowei's summary of civil law is really solid. Although it is really difficult to read, you can always understand the concept more clearly in the rich experience of teacher Xiaowei. It would be great if the presentations for the class could be uploaded earlier, with fewer corrections to be made!",48,366,0,1,0.9997878670692444
630cf1c440e337e60fce1aea,我覺得老師教得很棒，除了數學計算的部分，我覺得在這門課學到的更多是以後真的在財管上會用到的觀念與思考方式，而且老師十分幽默風趣，報告雖然有點小多，但聽說比起其他老師開的財管已經超佛心了，而且第一名與第二名的小組還有獎勵高級酒類，真的是大大提升做作業的動力，此外透過報告也讓我在這短短的一學期了解了各種的投資理財方式，真的挺開心，謝謝老師這學期的教導。,"I think the teacher's teaching is very good. Except for the part of mathematical calculation, I think what I learned in this course is more concepts and ways of thinking that will be used in financial management in the future, and the teacher is very humorous. Although the report It's a bit small, but I heard that compared with other teachers' financial management, it has surpassed the Buddha's heart, and the first and second teams also rewarded high-end alcohol, which really greatly improved the motivation to do homework. In addition, through the report It also allowed me to understand various investment and financial management methods in this short semester. I am really happy. Thank you teacher for teaching this semester.",122,438,0,3,0.9996418952941895
630cf1c340e337e60fce1a8e,老師講課幽默風趣，對於時事的分析具有深度，每次在上課的前半小時都會有非常多的收穫，無奈疫情嚴峻，這學期仍然無法前往原先預定的調查局參訪，並且課程改成線上課程上真的較難專注，不過老師針對疫情的轉變在分數上也有所調整，並且尊重學生意見，很讚！,"The teacher's lectures are humorous and humorous, and the analysis of current events is in-depth. Every time, there will be a lot of gains in the first half hour of class. However, the epidemic situation is severe. This semester is still unable to visit the originally scheduled investigation bureau, and the courses have been changed to online courses. It is really difficult to concentrate, but the teacher has also adjusted the score in response to the changes in the epidemic, and respects the opinions of the students, which is great!",151,431,0,1,0.9918938279151917

630cf1c440e337e60fce1afc,利用程式碼慢慢帶我們思考怎麼優化，會讓效率增加，讓程式更好寫，也教我們怎麼去想問題的解法，我覺得讓我的能力有增加一些。加上老師會補充其他相關例題可以課外練習，以及其他程式語言的寫法，讓我們更了解。遠距後有同學反應，線上上課容易分心，老師就又提供其他教學方式調整,"Using the code to slowly lead us to think about how to optimize will increase efficiency, make the program easier to write, and teach us how to think about the solution to the problem. I think it has increased my ability. In addition, the teacher will add other relevant examples for extracurricular exercises, as well as writing methods in other programming languages, so that we can understand better. After distance, some students reported that online classes are easy to be distracted, so the teacher provided other teaching method adjustments",959,432,0,3,0.9812945127487183
630cf1c340e337e60fce1a4b,體育的話，個人的力量都不一樣，有人做得好，有人做得不太好，這是應該的。所以我希望老師多了解不太會的學生們。,"In terms of sports, individual strengths are different. Some people do well, and some do not do well. This is as it should be. So I hope that the teacher will know more about the students who are not very good at it.",525,421,0,1,0.9778788089752197
630cf1c340e337e60fce1a4e,覺得老師上課教的有點太快，對於沒有籃球基礎的人來說可能會有些吃力,"I feel that the teacher is a little too fast in class, and it may be a bit difficult for people who have no basketball foundation",525,421,0,1,0.00021058320999145508

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b13,老師會在大家報告結束後提供詳細建議，不過希望可以減少報告次數，多一些修復相關知識的授課或者讓大家觀摩一些成品,"The teacher will provide detailed suggestions after everyone's report is over, but I hope that the number of reports can be reduced, more lectures on repairing related knowledge or let everyone observe some finished products",962,731,0,3,0.0011849403381347656
630cf1c440e337e60fce1af5,老師很關心學生的狀況 提問很樂意解答 也會補充很多日本知識：） 很高興選到老師的課,"The teacher is very concerned about the situation of the students, he is happy to answer questions, and will also add a lot of Japanese knowledge:) I am very happy to choose the teacher's class",323,418,0,1,0.9998605251312256
630cf1c340e337e60fce1a8c,沒什麼好挑的，沒去成參訪有點可惜。很有收穫的一門課，老師助教都很願意和學生互動、不吝嗇額外花時間和學生交換意見。,"There is nothing to choose, it is a pity that I did not visit Chengcheng. A very rewarding class, the teachers and teaching assistants are very willing to interact with the students and spend extra time exchanging ideas with the students.",151,431,0,1,0.9991536140441895

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b15,老師上課時會藉由舉例來讓學生了解相關的法律觀念，也鼓勵學生發問。若課後學生有問題想要詢問，老師也歡迎藉由寄信的方式來協助解惑。,"During class, teachers will use examples to let students understand relevant legal concepts, and encourage students to ask questions. If students have questions after class and want to ask, the teacher also welcomes to help solve the doubts by sending letters.",48,366,0,1,0.9970934391021729

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b58,老師在期末報告時提供了我很多意見，使我可以更加反思自己簡報上的呈現以及內容構思的不同看法,"The teacher provided me with a lot of opinions in the final report, which enabled me to reflect more on the presentation in my briefing and the different views on content conception",57,366,0,1,0.995678722858429

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b0f,我覺得老師可以設計除了講述和報告以外的上課內容，像是進行簡易簡單的修復操作，或者講述除了修復本身的內容(未來展望、行銷)，都能增添課程的豐富度，否則我覺得課堂中除了修復外，都是從準備報告中自行吸收知識。另外，我想給個額外小建議，感覺老師很想將文物修復推廣給更多人知道，我覺得可以和木曜的一日系列合作，進行「一日修復師」，那系列影片點閱率都還不錯，應該會有幫助~,"I think teachers can design class content other than narration and reports, such as simple and simple repair operations, or talk about content other than repair itself (future outlook, marketing), which can add richness to the course. Otherwise, I think that in the classroom Apart from the fixes, it's all self-absorbed from preparing reports. In addition, I would like to give an additional suggestion. I feel that the teacher wants to promote the restoration of cultural relics to more people. I think I can cooperate with Mu Yao's one-day series to carry out ""One-day Restoration"". Not bad, it should help~",962,731,0,3,0.022332727909088135
630cf1c340e337e60fce1aa4,老師會在下課時間一一認識班上同學，我認為是非常用心且貼心的行為！,The teacher will meet the students in the class one by one during the class time. I think it is a very thoughtful and caring behavior!,960,729,0,1,0.9996392726898193
630cf1c340e337e60fce1a82,對完全不太熟悉籃球、運動神經沒有這麼強的人，可能還是多少會覺得上課和考試內容有一些困難 但老師人很好～有問題的話可以直接詢問，老師有時也會主動給一些意見讓我們可以改善自己的動作,"For those who are not familiar with basketball at all and do not have such a strong motor nerve, they may still find it somewhat difficult to attend classes and test content, but the teacher is very nice~ If you have any questions, you can ask them directly, and the teacher will sometimes take the initiative to give some advice. we can improve our movements",525,421,0,1,0.9992479681968689

630cf1c340e337e60fce1a4f,老師教學認真，但有時候希望能顧及籃球初學者對於某些動作的熟練度需要慢慢累積，不要太快就教下一個進階動作,"The teacher is serious in teaching, but sometimes I hope to take into account that basketball beginners need to accumulate proficiency in certain movements slowly, and don't teach the next advanced movement too quickly",525,421,0,1,0.9560490846633911
630cf1c440e337e60fce1afb,老師上課時都會講解得很清楚，office hour時也很樂意解決學生的問題，也會利用比喻的方式讓學生更能理解抽象的概念。助教也給予很多幫助，有問題時也能很快解決。只是最後學期末的分組報告因為組員們不夠積極，準備過程有些辛苦。,"The teacher will explain very clearly in class, and is also happy to solve students' problems during office hours, and will also use metaphors to help students better understand abstract concepts. The teaching assistants also give a lot of help, and they can solve problems quickly when there are problems. It's just that the group report at the end of the last semester was a bit hard to prepare because the team members were not active enough.",959,432,0,3,0.027516484260559082
630cf1c340e337e60fce1aa3,果然是台灣人力資源管理學界的頂，無可挑剔。希望老師多開一點選修課,"Sure enough, it is the top of Taiwan's human resource management academic circle, impeccable. I hope the teacher offers more elective courses",960,729,0,1,0.9997878670692444
630cf1c340e337e60fce1aa6,老師教學方式很不錯，在教學的過程當中很長會點同學發揮意見。老師也不只是介紹人管理論給同學並有提供給我們個案以及相關文章，這樣的話我覺得我們可以實際得看人管在企業扮演的角色。老師教學的聲音也很溫，總之老師很好，也非常樂意跟學生們互動（並用中間下課時間來跟一些同學聊！,"The teacher's teaching method is very good. During the teaching process, he will ask the students to express their opinions for a long time. The teacher not only introduced the human management theory to the students, but also provided us with case studies and related articles. In this way, I think we can actually see the role of human management in the enterprise. The teacher's teaching voice is also very warm.

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b97,老師非常重視與尊重學生的想法，並且給予建議，非常謝謝老師熱誠的教學，透過同學的分享也學到許多。 老師能夠透過學生的報告，從各觀點進行切入，給予學生許多啟發。課程也非常有趣，可惜時間有限，人數也較多，或許老師最後能夠進行彙整，或是提點摘要。 而研究生的專題分享也非常有啟發性與學習性，很幸運能夠參與報告聆聽。 最後的小建議是，雖然是專題課，不過口頭／書面報告次數較多，希望能夠稍稍調整以減輕學生負擔，課中也可以休息一下，會更好集中精神。 謝謝老師的用心教導！,"The teacher attaches great importance to and respects the students' ideas and gives suggestions. Thank you very much for the enthusiastic teaching of the teacher, and I have learned a lot through the sharing of the students. Teachers can use students' reports to cut in from various perspectives and give students a lot of inspiration. The course is also very interesting, but unfortunately the time is limited and the number of people is large, maybe the teacher can compile it at the end or give a summary. The thematic sharing by graduate students is also very inspiring and learning, and I am lucky to be able to participate in the report listening. The last little suggestion is that although it is a special subject class, there are many oral/written reports. I hope to make some adjustments to reduce the burden on the students. You can also take a break during the class, so that you can concentrate better. Thank you teacher for your hard work!",967,734,0,2,0.998928964138031

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b5d,老師每堂課上課前都會在次複習之前的觀念，不斷地幫助我們釐清，這對吸收比較慢的我來說很有幫助。,"Before each class, the teacher will review the previous concepts again, and constantly help us clarify, which is very helpful for me who absorb slowly.",99,441,0,1,0.9982206225395203

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b5b,老師樂於為學生解惑，課外也會開放某個時段歡迎學生來詢問問題。課程內容常結合時事或生活例子來加深學生的印象~不過有時在教有關經濟學概念的圖時，會把不同情形畫在同一張圖上，導致圖有些許的混亂，同學來不及跟上時會容易產生疑惑。,"The teacher is happy to answer students' questions, and there will be a certain period of time after class to welcome students to ask questions. The course content is often combined with current events or life examples to deepen students’ impression~ However, sometimes when teaching diagrams related to economic concepts, different situations will be drawn on the same diagram, resulting in a little confusion in the diagrams, and students can’t keep up with the time Doubts can easily arise.",99,441,0,1,0.5053451061248779

630cf1c440e337e60fce1ba3,這次課程，老師的考試不會太難符合學生的程度，作業也沒有很多，作業和考試都是基本體目。,"In this course, the teacher's exams will not be too difficult to meet the students' level, and there are not many homework, homework and exams are the basic content.",99,447,0,1,0.011476695537567139
630cf1c440e337e60fce1bfa,老師教學認真，講義內容豐富，讓我獲益良多。,"The teacher is serious in teaching and the lecture notes are rich in content, which has benefited me a lot.",327,437,0,1,0.9998400211334229
630cf1c440e337e60fce1c0c,「可及性」觀念時時掛在嘴邊，且總會拿「遠距教學」作為舉例，看來老師似乎比學生更喜歡遠距呢。,"The concept of ""accessibility"" is always on the lips, and ""distance teaching"" is always used as an example. It seems that teachers seem to prefer distance than students.",972,436,0,1,0.6070994138717651
630cf1c540e337e60fce1e49,想學桌球找輝哥就對了!!,"If you want to learn billiards, go to Brother Hui!!",270,482,0,1,0.9959778189659119

630cf1c440e337e60fce1ba8,老師很認真，會分析一些實際案例，也會有一些自己的問題及想法，讓學生討論，內容很有深度，也偏重法律的部分，謝謝老師教導，辛苦了!,"The teacher is very serious and will analyze some actual cases, and also have some own problems and ideas for students to discuss. The content is very in-depth, and it also focuses on the legal part. Thank you teacher for teaching, hard work!",973,366,0,1,0.999675989151001
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b82,非常喜歡老師的授課模式，講解得非常詳細且非常用心，甚至會根據教學內容更改上課示範展現的程式，也總是一步一步帶著同學們，像是一段一段註解並且print，幫助同學們理解。對我來說總是很容易地理解，內容並不算困難，感謝老師！ p.s.實體授課展現程式時看投影幕會有點吃力，感覺字可以再大一些,"I like the teacher's teaching mode very much. The explanation is very detailed and very attentive. He even changes the demonstration program in class according to the teaching content. He always leads the students step by step, like commenting and printing paragraph by paragraph to help students understand. It is always easy for me to understand, the content is not too difficult, thank you teacher! p.s. It will be a bit difficult to watch the projection screen when showing the program in the physical lecture, I feel that the words can be bigger",970,442,0,3,0.9979123473167419
630cf1c440e337e60fce1baa,報告事宜改來改去，很晚通知，郵件內容有時又表達的不清楚 每堂課都有討論，但最後沒有給大家答案或意見，不知道自己討論的內容是不是對的,"The report was changed and changed, and the notification was late, and sometimes the content of the email was not clear. There were discussions in every class, but in the end, I didn’t give everyone answers or opinions. I didn’t know if the content I discussed was correct.",973,366,0,1,0.00028318166732788086
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b9e,謝謝老師每次的用心教學～（希望能夠稍微調整作業份量）,Thank you teacher for teaching hard every time~ (I hope to adjust the homework weight slightly),99,447,0,1,0.9884198904037476

630cf1c440e337e60fce1d0b,雖然老師一開學就有說這堂課很重了，但是一學期下來的感受是真的是重到不行⋯⋯六次個案、三次個人作業、期中考、期末書面、期末報告、期末考等，但也不得不說學到很多東西！！建議真的想好好了解也有心力好好對待的人再選這堂課，不然真的會很辛苦喔！,"Although the teacher said that the class was very heavy at the beginning of the semester, the feeling after the semester was that it was too heavy... Six cases, three personal assignments, mid-term exams, final written papers, final reports, final exams, etc., But I have to say I learned a lot! ! It is recommended that people who really want to understand and treat well take this class, otherwise it will be really hard!",558,455,3,2,0.08318710327148438
630cf1c440e337e60fce1c9b,謝謝老師一整學期的用心教學，感受到老師非常希望我們可以成為有學術素養的人，也教導我們如何做出一份對於學術界有意義的研究。 雖然學習並解決了許多以前一直對「做研究」感到困惑的地方，然而依舊認為政方好難呀！ 謝謝老師，老師辛苦了～～,"Thank you teacher for your whole semester of hard teaching. I feel that the teacher very much hopes that we can become academically educated people, and also teaches us how to make a meaningful research for the academic world. Although I have learned and solved many things that I have been confused about ""doing research"" before, I still think that the government is so difficult! Thank you, teacher, for your hard work~~",969,458,0,1,0.9983071088790894
630cf1c440e337e60fce1be7,謝謝教授，上課會補充一些時事例如Fed升息等，非常實用的一堂課,"Thank you, professor, the class will add some current events such as Fed interest rate hike, etc., a very practical class",212,447,0,2,0.9996078610420227

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b68,老師每次都會複習之前教過的內容! 順便解答我的疑問，超級感謝~ 有時候講的笑話也很好笑 總之非常喜歡上老師的課 耶,"The teacher will review the content taught before every time! By the way, I will answer my questions, thank you very much~ Sometimes the jokes I tell are also very funny. Anyway, I really like the teacher’s class.",99,441,0,1,0.9996628761291504
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b6d,老師上課很清楚，每堂課上課都會先複習前面所學，讓忘了複習的人也能快速跟上進度。只是板書有時候轉瞬即逝，只能下課再回去超。,"The teacher is very clear in class, and every class will review what he has learned before, so that those who forgot to review can quickly catch up with the progress. It’s just that blackboard writing is sometimes fleeting, so I can only go back to class after class.",99,441,0,1,0.9013777375221252
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b64,老師教的很好人也很好，很喜歡老師對於經濟學時事的補充，讓我可以更了解經濟學在生活中的運用，也更可以用經濟學的思考模式來思考不同的社會議題,"The teacher is very good and the people are very nice. I really like the teacher's supplementary information on current economics. It allows me to better understand the application of economics in my life, and I can also use the thinking mode of economics to think about different social issues.",99,441,0,1,0.9998251795768738
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b6b,老師棒棒,great teacher,99,441,0,1,0.9998414516448975
630cf1c440e337e60fce1bf5,老師真的非常非常用心 超級感謝老師每個星期和我們一起討論 都會給一個方向跟建議讓我們不會太迷茫 老師謝謝！！,"The teacher is really very attentive. Thank you very much for discussing with us every week. He will give us a direction and advice so that we will not be too confused. Thank you, teacher! !",976,451,0,3,0.9998471736907959
630cf1c440e337e60fce1bfc,老師這學期辛苦了！每次有問題去尋求老師的幫助，都會得到非常清楚的解答！,"The teacher has worked hard this semester! Every time I have a question and ask the teacher for help, I will get a very clear answer!",327,437,0,1,0.9964152574539185
630cf1c540e337e60fce1e06,老師人超好！很細心注意每個同學的動作並且仔細教學，讓我進步很多。,"The teacher is super nice! I pay close attention to each student's movements and teach carefully, which made me improve a lot.",270,482,0,1,0.9998337030410767
630cf1c440e337e60fce1d5d,課程內容深入淺出，在沒有基礎的情況下也可以很好理解很多的政黨原理。,"The content of the course is simple, and you can understand many principles of political parties without a foundation.",968,458,0,2,0.9466230273246765
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b7f,政大最佳的Python課程大概沒有之一，老師的上課結構相當清晰，所學最終能真實的應用,"There is probably not one of the best Python courses at National Chengchi University. The teacher's class structure is quite clear, and what he has learned can be applied in the end",970,442,0,3,0.18173950910568237
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b5c,實體上課寫白板時字可以大一點,"When writing on the whiteboard in physical class, the words can be larger",99,441,0,1,0.8895379304885864
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b94,文字報告太多,too many text reports,967,734,0,2,0.0004826784133911133
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b79,老師好善良好好笑！但希望每個禮拜小考的範圍可以請助教早點公布，或是可以在一開始就先預先排好每個禮拜大致的範圍，之後需要做小幅度修正都可以，這樣我們才能提早準備~,"The teacher is so kind and funny! But I hope that the scope of the quiz for each week can be announced by the teaching assistant earlier, or the approximate scope of each week can be pre-arranged at the beginning, and small corrections can be made later, so that we can prepare early~",549,451,0,1,0.006919443607330322
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b5e,線上課程或是實體課程都很棒，只是線上課程能夠更方便地複習，以及有時候筆記有缺漏就能馬上倒帶重看，我覺得自己的學習效果有更好。謝謝老師這一年來的教導，真的讓我對經濟學更有興趣了！,"Both online courses and physical courses are great, but online courses can be reviewed more conveniently, and sometimes the notes can be replayed immediately if there are gaps in the notes. I think my learning effect is better. Thank you teacher for teaching this year, it really made me more interested in economics!",99,441,0,1,0.9871127009391785
630cf1c440e337e60fce1c0b,讚,great,972,436,0,1,0.9998630285263062
630cf1c440e337e60fce1bfe,謝謝老師！,"Thank you, teacher!",129,445,0,1,0.9998482465744019
630cf1c540e337e60fce1e50,能及早給予作業的回饋讓我們有較充裕的時間可以更正,Early feedback on homework gives us more time to make corrections,588,488,3,3,0.004596829414367676
630cf1c540e337e60fce1e18,整體而言我非常喜歡這堂課，謝謝老師總是不厭其煩教我正確的打球姿勢，我在這堂課中也交到了一些朋友。謝謝老師一學期的教導！,"Overall, I like this class very much. Thank you teacher for always taking the trouble to teach me the correct playing posture. I also made some friends in this class. Thank you teacher for teaching for a semester!",270,482,0,1,0.9998517036437988
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b76,老師很認真，雖然聲音有一點點催眠，但是課程內容都講解的很清楚完整，有上課的話基本上都能理解內容,"The teacher is very serious. Although the voice is a little hypnotic, the content of the course is very clear and complete. If you have a class, you can basically understand the content",549,451,0,1,0.999760091304779
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b96,老師非常會帶動討論，並且會鼓勵每一位學生的報告與發言，非常喜歡老師，是很溫暖的教授。,"The teacher is very good at driving discussions, and will encourage every student's report and speech. I like the teacher very much and is a very warm professor.",967,734,0,2,0.9998732805252075
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b95,真的很幸運能夠修到這堂課，無論是每週的指定閱讀（雖然有時候負荷量蠻大的）或是課堂間的討論，都讓我感受到滿滿的人群移動歷史的魅力，並開始建立不一樣的觀點來看待歷史，一學期兩次的導讀更是可以有機會的更深入去了解這些人群移動的故事，在課堂上老師也會引導我們且給予同學鼓勵，是值得一修的專題課程！,"I am really lucky to be able to take this class. Whether it is the weekly assigned reading (although sometimes the load is quite heavy) or the discussion between classes, I feel the charm of the full crowd moving history, and Start to establish a different point of view to look at history. The two guided readings in a semester can give you the opportunity to understand the stories of these people’s movements in depth. In class, the teacher will also guide us and give encouragement to the students. It is worthwhile to study Topic course!",967,734,0,2,0.9998021721839905

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b74,老師很棒,great teacher,99,441,0,1,0.9998414516448975
630cf1c440e337e60fce1be6,建議老師遠距的時後可以不要在ppt的圖上面再畫圖 畫面變得有點亂會有點難跟上,It is suggested that the teacher should not draw pictures on top of the ppt pictures when the teacher is far away. The picture will become a bit messy and it will be difficult to keep up,212,447,0,2,0.00021797418594360352
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b60,很棒,great,99,441,0,1,0.9998630285263062
630cf1c440e337e60fce1bf9,希望老師可以多距離，不然有些觀念太過抽象,"I hope the teacher can be more distant, otherwise some concepts are too abstract",327,437,0,1,0.0002523064613342285
630cf1c440e337e60fce1c08,很喜歡老師在上課談論到自己的想法，並鼓勵學生要多思考,I really like that the teacher talks about his thoughts in class and encourages students to think more,972,436,0,1,0.9996275901794434
630cf1c440e337e60fce1c70,雖然一開始不太習慣被點發言的模式，不過也謝謝老師給我們這樣練習開口的機會，尤其因為要講英文所以還不錯，謝謝老師帶我們認識保險！,"Although I was not used to the mode of being asked to speak at the beginning, I also thank the teacher for giving us the opportunity to practice speaking, especially because we have to speak English, so it is not bad. Thank you teacher for introducing us to insurance!",229,470,3,3,0.9997894167900085
630cf1c540e337e60fce1df4,老師的課程內容非常紮實，且非常的有條理，特別是簡報非常精美且會適時更新，上課也會運用實務案例幫助同學了解，平時也非常熱於解決同學在課堂上的問題，受益良多。,"The course content of the teacher is very solid and very organized, especially the briefing is very exquisite and will be updated in due course, and practical cases will be used to help students understand in class. He is also very keen on solving students' problems in class and has benefited a lot.",977,475,0,3,0.9998648166656494
630cf1c440e337e60fce1c6b,老師上課很認真也很樂於回答同學的問題，但是上課進度稍微比較慢，課堂中也比較少時間讓同學來做對話練習，建議老師可以稍微加快上課速度，文本翻譯的部分可以減少，除了課本內容也可以增加課外部分,"The teacher is very serious in class and willing to answer students' questions, but the progress of the class is a bit slow, and there is less time for students to do dialogue exercises in class. It is suggested that the teacher can speed up the class a little bit, and the part of text translation can be reduced, except for the textbook content Extra-curricular parts can also be added",978,456,0,3,0.0028208494186401367
630cf1c540e337e60fce1e31,希望請來的業師可以多講一點技術層面的東西。,I hope that the professional teachers invited can talk more about the technical aspects.,979,735,0,3,0.7863845229148865

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b78,老師活潑可愛 應該不會有上課想睡覺的問題,"The teacher is lively and cute, there should be no problem of falling asleep in class",549,451,0,1,0.9996782541275024
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b67,老師辛苦了,Teacher worked hard,99,441,0,1,0.9943681359291077
630cf1c540e337e60fce1dea,第一次修詹老師的課，老師的教學給人一種穩健的感覺。,"This is the first time I took Teacher Zhan's class, and the teacher's teaching gives people a sense of stability.",977,475,0,3,0.9997376799583435

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e39,很感謝老師!從初級修到中級後感覺桌球真的有進步!,"Thank you very much, teacher! I feel that billiards has really improved from the elementary level to the intermediate level!",265,482,0,1,0.9998420476913452
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b9d,希望老師的課可以改成非同步錄影 因為老師上課畫的筆記有點多 很難上課都抄完,"I hope the teacher's class can be changed to asynchronous video recording, because the teacher draws a lot of notes in class, and it is difficult to copy them all in class",99,447,0,1,0.001347184181213379
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b89,完美老師。課程線上、有影片紀錄、課程規劃好、上課有條理、作業也有挑戰但又不會太難。真的不知道要怎麼建議。,"perfect teacher. The courses are online, there are video recordings, the courses are well planned, the classes are organized, and the assignments are challenging but not too difficult. Really don't know what to suggest.",980,445,3,3,0.563341498374939
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b84,課程設計紮實，老師很注重程式的邏輯思維，而非只是用別人寫好的套件來寫程式。我之前有上過通識的程式概論跟其他線上課程，覺得loading蠻剛好的，但對於零基礎的人可能會有些吃力。,"The course design is solid, and the teacher pays great attention to the logical thinking of the program, rather than just using the kit written by others to write the program. I have taken General Programming Introduction and other online courses before, and I think loading is just right, but it may be a bit difficult for people with zero foundation.",970,442,0,3,0.9961026906967163
630cf1c440e337e60fce1be3,老師會和學生討論段考時程、考試題型配分等，蠻尊重學生意見的!,"The teacher will discuss with the students the schedule of the section exam, the allocation of exam question types, etc., and respects the opinions of the students!",212,447,0,2,0.9997738003730774
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b5f,超喜歡老師～教學很用心，都會聽同學的建議並改善教學方式等！老師課前也會複習上週內容，讓同學更進入狀況，而且同學提問時都會非常有耐心的重複講解。老師講話也很好笑，幽默且教學用心～謝謝老師！也推薦其他同學修蔡老師的課。,"I really like the teacher~ I am very attentive in teaching, and I will listen to the suggestions of my classmates and improve the teaching methods, etc.! The teacher will also review the content of last week before class, so that the students can get into the situation better, and the students will repeat the explanation very patiently when they ask questions. The teacher's speech is also very funny, humorous and attentive to teaching ~ Thank you teacher! I also recommend other students to take teacher Cai's class.",99,441,0,1,0.9997637867927551
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b7b,上課生動有趣，老師和小怪獸都很可愛哈哈哈,"The class is lively and interesting, the teacher and the little monster are very cute hahaha",549,451,0,1,0.9998596906661987
630cf1c440e337e60fce1b61,因為人數很多，目前上課是在一個長的大教室上課，我坐後面一點的黑板斗看不清楚，希望實體課的話可以解決這個問題；另外，這個課給學生很大的自由，但我覺得可以給更多的作業，雖然有些學生可能會抱怨，但學生才會乖乖讀書，學習效果會好一點,"Because of the large number of people, the class is currently held in a long classroom. I can’t see clearly from the blackboard at the back. I hope that the physical class can solve this problem. In addition, this class gives students a lot of freedom, but I think it’s ok Give more homework, although some students may complain, but students will study obediently, and the learning effect will be better",99,441,0,1,0.04123401641845703

630cf1c440e337e60fce1d20,許會人很好 但上課方式不要那麼像高速唸PPT的機器會讓人更好吸收 建議可以以實務分享取代意義不太大的報告 就上學期的經驗有再聽的人其實不多,"Xu Hui is a very nice person, but the way of teaching should not be so like a machine reading PPT at high speed, it will make people absorb better. It is suggested that practical sharing can be used instead of less meaningful reports. Not many people listen to the experience of last semester.",215,464,0,3,0.3316687345504761

630cf1c540e337e60fce1dcd,每週都要交作業，進度雖然不快但很充實，作業有一些是上課沒教的內容，雖然有給資源但要花一些時間準備，有時候作業會有夠難 期中期末難度適中,"Homework is due every week. Although the progress is not fast, it is very fulfilling.

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b9b,明福老師人很好，考試的負擔不會很重，可能講課速度要再掌握一些。作業部分希望可以在期初先跟同學預告什麼時候要寫，比較不會突然應接不暇（我認為這些作業可能會需要花一些時間來完成）。最後雖然可能法律系同學佔多數，但還是希望老師可以不要預設台下都是法律系同學QQ。,"Teacher Ming Fu is very kind, and the burden of the exam will not be too heavy. Maybe the speed of the lectures needs to be mastered. For the homework part, I hope that I can tell my classmates when I will write it at the beginning of the term, so that I will not be overwhelmed suddenly (I think these homework may take some time to complete).

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e53,不簡單的課，每週都要寫作文，但認真學可以學到很多，老師也算是很認真的批改，老師也給很多課後資源，但還是希望老師可以在課堂上多示範跟講解，效果應該會比請上生回家看閱讀好，但總結是很充實很扎實的課，不會壓力太大，沒有很會寫也可以上，想練英文作文的同學可以修。,"It's not an easy class, and you have to write essays every week, but you can learn a lot if you study hard, and the teacher is very serious about correcting, and the teacher also provides a lot of resources after class, but I still hope that the teacher can demonstrate and explain more in class. It should be better than asking senior students to go home to read and read, but the summary is a very substantial and solid class, and it will not be too stressful.

630cf1c440e337e60fce1d3a,教授經常鼓勵學生提出對文學作品的看法，並且肯定學生的意見，再提出自己的看法。讓學生跟教授討論的時候不會感到壓力或害怕自己說錯。,"Professors often encourage students to put forward their opinions on literary works, and affirm students' opinions before putting forward their own opinions.

630cf1c440e337e60fce1d11,老師很認真準備每次的個案討論，都講解得很清楚，也都有與上課內容做連結~ 不過遠距後效率明顯不如實體授課，如果未來有遠距的需求，老師可能要想一下怎麼加快線上討論個案的速度，但總體而言是蠻充實的一堂課~,"The teacher carefully prepares each individual case discussion, explaining it very clearly, and linking it with the class content~ However, the efficiency after distance is obviously not as good as physical teaching. If there is a need for distance in the future, the teacher may think about how to speed up The speed of discussing individual cases online, but overall it is quite a fulfilling class~",558,455,3,2,0.9932343363761902

630cf1c440e337e60fce1bdc,由於這堂課有請民族系系上老師來說明當初課程的開設流程 因此能瞭解作為一名教師開設課程的目標與方向，及欲培育學生的能力為何  不過，因為自己並非民族系學生 因此對民族系系上課程的專業並不熟悉 無法給予一些較實用的建議回饋,"In this class, a teacher from the Department of Ethnic Studies was invited to explain the process of opening the course at the beginning, so I can understand the goal and direction of the course as a teacher, and why the ability to cultivate students is not enough, because I am not a student of the Department of Ethnic Studies I am not familiar with the majors of the courses in the department and cannot give some practical suggestions and feedback",974,453,0,3,0.005367398262023926

630cf1c440e337e60fce1bad,老師課程準備充足，也會給我們預習以增加教學深度。 但在遠距上課時常常沒有準時下課，同學們也不好意思離開座位，因此希望老師可以準時下課。,"The teacher is well-prepared for the course and will also give us a preview to increase the depth of teaching. However, when the class is held remotely, the class is often not finished on time, and the students are embarrassed to leave their seats, so I hope the teacher can finish the class on time.",983,453,0,2,0.7350151538848877

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e09,老師各方面都很好，惟授課進度對於無基礎者不算友善，望老師斟酌放慢腳步（特指學期中之後，個人認為學期初的進度適中）,"The teacher is very good in all aspects, but the teaching progress is not friendly to those who have no foundation. I hope the teacher will consider slowing down (especially after the middle of the semester, personally think that the progress at the beginning of the semester is moderate)",270,482,0,1,0.0033126473426818848

630cf1c440e337e60fce1b85,真的非常推薦這堂課，但建議有一點程式設計基礎再來修，不然交作業的時候會非常辛苦。但老師真的教得非常好，助教也超級負責任，問問題都非常快就回覆！,"I really recommend this course, but it is recommended to take a little programming foundation before taking it, otherwise it will be very hard when handing in homework. But the teacher really teaches very well, and the teaching assistants are also super responsible, and all questions are answered very quickly!",970,442,0,3,0.9993101358413696
630cf1c440e337e60fce1bdf,這堂課可以從來自不同領域的老師中學習到很多知識，助教也非常認真，課程中會帶領同學執行各項設計思考階段並一同腦力激盪，和公行系原有習慣的思維蠻不同的，覺得是一個很棒的課程，雖然每周都會有作業但負擔不重，蠻推薦有興趣或跨領域的人可以找好夥伴來修！也期待這堂課未來有更多元和更多的可能性結合！最後，建議老師在讓學生發掘問題作為思考主題時或許可以和政府/學校等合作，提供他們遇到的問題並讓學生從設計思考進一步來解決，這樣或許能發揮更多這堂課的價值。,"This class can learn a lot of knowledge from teachers from different fields, and the teaching assistants are also very serious. During the course, students will lead students to implement various design thinking stages and brainstorm together, which is quite different from the original thinking of the Public Bank Department. I think it is a great course. Although there are homework every week, the burden is not heavy. I recommend that those who are interested or cross-field can find a good partner to take it! I also look forward to more diverse and more possible combinations in this class in the future! Finally, it is suggested that teachers may cooperate with the government/schools when asking students to discover problems as the theme of thinking, provide the problems they encounter and let students go further to solve them from design thinking, so that the value of this class may be maximized.",984,736,0,3,0.9988480806350708
630cf1c440e337e60fce1baf,老師上課對學生很有耐心，從老師的反饋中總能獲得信心！,"The teacher is very patient with the students in class, and you can always gain confidence from the teacher's feedback!",975,452,3,3,0.9997888207435608

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e47,很開心選上老師的桌球課，雖然沒有運動的底子，但跟著老師上課進度，逐步增加自己的實力與信心，發自內心喜歡上了桌球這個運動！,"I am very happy to have chosen the teacher's billiards class. Although I have no sports background, I have gradually increased my strength and confidence by following the teacher's progress in class, and I fell in love with the sport of billiards from the bottom of my heart!",270,482,0,1,0.9997034668922424
630cf1c540e337e60fce1e0a,雙人對打的比賽如果遇到很強的對手就慘慘慘…畢竟我只是菜鳥,"If you meet a strong opponent in a doubles match, it will be miserable... After all, I am just a rookie",270,482,0,1,0.0003764629364013672

630cf1c440e337e60fce1d34,很喜歡老師帶我們閱讀、思考文學作品和社會議題。希望老師可以把上課步調和學生報告的時間掌握好。很喜歡上老師的課，獲益良多！謝謝老師。,"I really like the teacher taking us to read and think about literary works and social issues.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1de9,老師真的是超級公法大師，這堂課不只是地方自治法，還會講到行政法跟憲法等，真的是賺到！跟著老師教課還可以練習系統性、邏輯性的論述能力，真的收穫滿滿，很幸運能選到這堂課！,"The teacher is really a super master of public law. This class is not only about local self-government law, but also administrative law and the constitution. It is really profitable! Following the teacher's class can also practice systematic and logical argumentation skills, which is really rewarding. I am very lucky to choose this class!",977,475,0,3,0.9998162388801575
630cf1c540e337e60fce1dcc,作業量可再斟酌，雖然寫程式需要練習，但是學生不是只有這一門科需要學習，所以目前的作業量對我們來說負擔有點大。另外，希望老師能公布期中考的分數。謝謝老師這學期的教導。,"The amount of homework can be considered. Although programming requires practice, students are not the only subject to learn, so the current homework load is a bit heavy for us. In addition, I hope the teacher can announce the scores of the midterm exam. Thank you teacher for your teaching this semester.",970,476,0,1,0.07993024587631226

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e19,希望老師考試的給分可以再高一點，畢竟這門課大家都是初學者，有些人甚至不擅長球類運動，沒辦法把動作做到100%完美、標準，每個禮拜也只有這不到兩小時能夠打球，也不是每個人都能在場上練滿兩小時，短時間內要學會技巧性的動作，並在考試中靈活運用還蠻困難的。但老師都會來刁學生的動作，並給予高度鼓勵與耐心，這點非常好～,"I hope the teacher’s test score can be higher. After all, everyone in this class is a beginner. Some people are not even good at ball games. There is no way to make the movements 100% perfect and standard. Every week is only less than this You can play for two hours, and not everyone can practice for two hours on the court. It is quite difficult to learn technical movements in a short period of time and use them flexibly in the exam.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1d96,期末考試的方式因為線上進行，個人覺得對前面考試的組別不太公平，老師因為事先在聊天室貼題目了所以縮減進場編對話的5分鐘，但實際上對前面考試的組來說，在拿到題目、掃過題目後基本上就快到考試時間，沒什麼時間仔細看個別題目和編對話，等同少去了原本考試可以編的5分鐘，幾乎是現場又再重新仔細看題、臨場編對話，和後面考試的組對比也不太公平。這學期很努力也花很多時間在複習日文會話，考試的方式實在讓人感到有點挫折。,"Because the final exam is conducted online, I personally feel that it is not fair to the group of the previous exam. Because the teacher posted the questions in the chat room in advance, he shortened the 5 minutes of the interview, but in fact, for the group of the previous exam, After getting the questions and scanning the questions, it is almost time for the exam. There is no time to carefully read individual questions and edit the dialogue. It is equivalent to losing 5 minutes of the original exam that could be edited. Compiled dialogue, and the group comparison with the later exam is not fair. I worked hard this semester and spent a lot of time reviewing Japanese conversation. The way the exam was conducted was a bit frustrating.",66,472,0,1,0.00037872791290283203
630cf1c540e337e60fce1e38,老師人很好，會到各桌看大家打球狀況並給建議，且期中考前有給大家足夠時間練習，期中後分組打比賽很好玩，也可以測試自己實力在哪~~,"The teacher is very nice, he will go to each table to see everyone's playing situation and give advice, and there is enough time for everyone to practice before the midterm exam, and it is fun to play in groups after the midterm, and you can also test your own strength~~",265,482,0,1,0.9990590214729309
630cf1c440e337e60fce1d79,老師認真準備課堂內容，也很有耐心引導學生表達自己的想法。不過建議老師可以把上課的主題和內容整理成簡報檔（或是至少在白板上用列點的方式呈現），比較不會因為聽了太多同學的回答而模糊焦點，也有助於課後複習。,"The teacher carefully prepares the class content and patiently guides the students to express their ideas. However, it is suggested that the teacher can organize the topics and contents of the class into a briefing file (or at least present it in the form of a list on the whiteboard), so that the focus will not be blurred due to listening to too many students' answers, and it will also help review after class .",960,737,3,3,0.038909196853637695

This semester, because of taking this yoga class, the muscles and veins of the body have been effectively stretched.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e75,我認為這堂課是一門如果能專心聽滿三個小時會收穫很多的課！提到很多理論，也做了入門的討論，讓人眼界大開。不過因為都是理論，不免有些無聊，要有熱忱才能打起精神。在劇場上課時的分組讓人有點摸不著頭緒，十人到十五人一組有點多，不過是有趣的分組經驗。,"I think this class is a class that if you can pay attention to it for three hours, you will gain a lot! A lot of theories were mentioned, and an introductory discussion was also made, which opened people's eyes. But because it's all theory, it can't help but be a bit boring, and it takes enthusiasm to cheer up.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1f0c,非常感謝老師能在假日回覆同學們向您詢問作業問題的信件，不過老師若能在出作業前先了解過作業內容，或許可以減輕許多雙方的困擾，老師或許能更快了解到我們的問題是什麼，能在出作業前發現作業題目的問題，而我們也能減少在假日打擾老師的機會。非常謝謝老師這學期的教學！,"I am very grateful to the teacher for replying to the letters from the students asking you about homework questions during the holidays. However, if the teacher can understand the content of the homework before giving the homework, it may alleviate many of the troubles of both parties, and the teacher may be able to understand our problems faster.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e3a,這學期後半因為遠距所以沒機會打到分組比賽有點可惜，不過我認為老師分組讓組內成員能夠互相練習的想法很棒，但是若組內實力差距比較大的話可能在練習上會有一方無法配合另一方的問題，這個是比較大的問題,"It's a pity that I didn't have the chance to play in groups in the second half of this semester because of the distance, but I think the idea of the teacher dividing into groups so that members in the group can practice with each other is great, but if there is a big gap in the strength of the group, there may be one party who cannot practice.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1da7,雖然上課跟考試都要及時編對話很有挑戰性，有時或許也會讓人有點壓力，但真的就是在這樣的練習之下，發現自己的口說能力有明顯進步! 不會那麼害怕開口說日文了，平時老師也都是很親切地在和學生互動，所以是個能鍛鍊口說的好地方!,"Although it is very challenging to make up dialogues in time for class and exams, and sometimes it may be a little stressful, but after this kind of practice, I found that my speaking ability has improved significantly! I will not be so afraid to speak Speaking Japanese, the teachers usually interact with the students very cordially, so it is a good place to practice speaking!",70,472,2,1,0.9995869994163513

630cf1c540e337e60fce1d7d,老師時常會以實際案例帶我們了解法條實際的運用，讓商事法變得非常有趣，謝謝老師的教導。,"The teacher often uses actual cases to guide us to understand the actual application of the law, which makes commercial law very interesting. Thank you for your teaching.",57,474,0,1,0.9998094439506531

630cf1c540e337e60fce1dad,老師會鼓勵我們獨立思考，但也會帶我們了解個案內容和背景，再用引導的方式讓學生往對的方向思考。當我們發言的時候即使答錯老師也不會怎麼樣，反而是用討論的方式來和我們探討個案內容。在這堂課我學到了很多，真的很喜歡管理學這堂課。,"The teacher will encourage us to think independently, but will also guide us to understand the content and background of the case, and then guide the students to think in the right direction. When we speak, even if the teacher gives the wrong answer, it will not do anything. Instead, he discusses the content of the case with us through discussion. I learned a lot in this class and really enjoyed the management class.",9,485,0,1,0.9987207055091858
630cf1c440e337e60fce1cad,老師上課認真，板書內容詳細。但希望在編排和分類上可以更有邏輯一點。,The teacher is serious in class and writes on the blackboard in detail. But I hope that the arrangement and classification can be more logical.,996,459,0,3,0.12166351079940796

630cf1c540e337e60fce1f0b,老師辛苦了,Teacher worked hard,989,502,0,1,0.9943681359291077
630cf1c540e337e60fce1efb,老師複習動作認真度滿分，不過教學如果能更有耐性的話，同學們的學習效果應該會更好,"The teacher's seriousness in reviewing the movements is perfect, but if the teaching can be more patient, the students' learning effect should be better",592,494,0,1,0.01292717456817627

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e37,點名可以明確一點比較沒有爭議～不然都不知道是否正確,"The roll call can be clearer and less controversial~ Otherwise, I don’t know if it is correct",265,482,0,1,0.0029845237731933594
630cf1c540e337e60fce1d92,學到很多，但考試是隨機抽題目，稍稍有點難。,"I learned a lot, but the exam is a little difficult because the questions are randomly selected.",66,472,0,1,0.002888202667236328
630cf1c440e337e60fce1c6c,希望有些考試可以再調整，像是期中翻譯題數太多，而且難度有點高,"I hope that some exams can be adjusted again, for example, there are too many translation questions in the mid-term, and the difficulty is a bit high",978,456,0,3,0.00035512447357177734
630cf1c440e337e60fce1d38,非常喜歡老師的上課模式，鼓勵我們分享自己的觀點，並且給予我們很多信心！,"I really like the teacher's class mode, encourage us to share our views, and give us a lot of confidence!",982,467,3,1,0.9998695850372314
630cf1c540e337e60fce1e2e,老師很認真，會一直鼓勵我們,The teacher is very serious and will always encourage us,270,482,0,1,0.99986732006073
630cf1c540e337e60fce1daf,我覺得可以先提出跟個案有關的問題讓同學在上課前思考，因為其實剛接觸個案，重點的掌握還沒那麼熟悉,"I think you can ask questions related to the case first for students to think before class, because in fact, they are new to the case, and they are not so familiar with the key points",9,485,0,1,0.0856708288192749
630cf1c440e337e60fce1cb0,老師基本上把我們當小學生在教課，一些演算法的概念都會從頭一步步帶我們做，一開始剛接觸的確會有點吃力，但越講越多之後就慢慢進入狀況了。,"The teacher basically treats us as elementary school students and teaches us some concepts of algorithms step by step. It will be a bit difficult at first, but the more you talk, the more you will get into the situation.",996,459,0,3,0.3141072988510132
630cf1c540e337e60fce1dac,謝凱宇老師很認真專業，自己的經驗也很豐富，學生有需求也都願意幫忙，是很親切的好老師。針對上課的話我覺得這個課程講的都是企業高層在思考的問題，對大一沒有社會經驗的同學來說可能比較不親切，比較遙遠。,"Teacher Xie Kaiyu is very serious and professional, and he has rich experience. He is willing to help students when they need it. He is a very kind and good teacher. Regarding the class, I think this course is all about the issues that the top executives of the company are thinking about. It may be less friendly and distant to students who have no social experience in the freshman year.",9,485,0,1,0.9990934133529663
630cf1c440e337e60fce1c3f,獲益良多 感謝,Thanks a lot,571,466,0,3,0.999806821346283
630cf1c540e337e60fce1ee4,希望老師們對課程教學能更有共識或互相討論過，然後也希望可以再思考做模型的必要性，花了很多時間很多錢去製作，但實際用處好像並不大。並且在實施全面遠 距後仍要求學生將模型製作完成也不甚合理，雖然老師們說可以讓留在北部的同學 來幫忙，但因為先前的各種工作都已分工完成且已開始進行書面擢寫，難以說要重 新分工就重新分配，變成有些同學會為了模型而留在學校宿舍，增加染疫風險，讓 人想重新思考那全面遠距的意義又為何,"I hope that the teachers can have a more consensus on the teaching of the course or have discussed with each other, and then I also hope that I can rethink the necessity of making models. It took a lot of time and money to make it, but the actual use does not seem to be great. And it is unreasonable to still require students to complete the model after the implementation of full distance. Although the teachers said that students who stayed in the north can help, but because the previous tasks have been divided and written work has begun , It is hard to say that if you want to re-divide the labor, you will re-allocate it. Some students will stay in the school dormitory for the model, which increases the risk of infection, and makes people want to rethink the meaning of the comprehensive distance.",475,515,0,1,0.0009475350379943848
630cf1c540e337e60fce1f41,本課程幾乎都是外師講解，作為上過教授幾乎所有課的學生來說，覺得較為可惜的是沒辦法聽到教授自己對課程幾個主題的看法（但疫情好像也沒辦法），但整體而言都很棒。,"This course is almost all explained by foreign teachers. As a student who has taught almost all courses, it is a pity that there is no way to hear the professor's own views on several topics of the course (but the epidemic seems to be the same), but overall Words are great.",997,493,0,3,0.9983211159706116
630cf1c540e337e60fce1ee5,老師個性較為嚴謹，且對於簡報、計畫書等等較為嚴格，但希望老師可以多強調「架構」，因為一學年下來同學們常常都不清楚老師確切要的是什麼內容、什麼架構。在老師們共同教導一堂課的情況下也希望老師們可以相互配合，否則對於很多事好像老師們之間也都欠缺討論，對於作品的看法時常老師之間不協調。,"The teacher's personality is more rigorous, and he is more strict with presentations, proposals, etc., but I hope the teacher can emphasize more on ""structure"", because after a school year, students often don't know exactly what content and structure the teacher wants. When the teachers are teaching a class together, I also hope that the teachers can cooperate with each other. Otherwise, there seems to be a lack of discussion among the teachers for many things, and the teachers often have inconsistent views on the works.",475,515,0,1,0.001996457576751709

I think there is not enough time for computer-based exams in the midterm exam. These situations will cause some pressure for beginners.

630cf1c440e337e60fce1c98,作業及報告份量太多，希望老師理解學生不是只有這堂課的事情要做，對於初次接觸研究的學生要求過高，根本讓學生拒老師最愛的量化研究於千里之外，期初說的「不會太為難對研究真的沒轍的學生」這句話聽聽就好，一旦遠距考試難度就增加，考試延後到本來要交資料分析作業的那天結果作業還是那天要交，真的不要把學生當成整天很閒有辦法天天搞研究的人，這堂課被列為政治系必修真的太荼毒學生了，建議改成選修讓熱愛研究仔有個取暖同溫層就好，期末一堆課要唸還要浪費時間找跟看這堂課期末報告的外文論文，老師要求又超多,"There are too many assignments and reports. I hope the teacher understands that students are not the only things to do in this class. The requirements for students who are new to research are too high, which makes students reject the teacher's favorite quantitative research thousands of miles away. At the beginning of the semester, they said ""no It will be too embarrassing for students who really don't know how to do research."" Just listen to this sentence. Once the distance test becomes more difficult, the test will be postponed to the day when the data analysis assignment should be due, but the assignment will still be due on the same day. Really don't put it Students should be regarded as people who are free all day and have the means to do research every day. This class is listed as a compulsory course in the Department of Politics.

It's just that the teacher's voice is a bit low, but overall I still like the teacher's class, thank you teacher for making human physiology interesting.",988,738,0,1,0.9997759461402893
630cf1c540e337e60fce1e76,課程內容的主題應該更具體，有些單元的課程過於哲學性的議題，但我們不是哲學系的學生，很常聽不懂老師到底要表達得內容是什麼。,"The topics of the course content should be more specific. Some unit courses are too philosophical, but we are not students in the philosophy department, and we often do not understand what the teacher is trying to express.",992,483,0,1,0.0008210539817810059

630cf1c540e337e60fce1f0d,老師上課進度沒有掌握好，所以導致後面一直在趕課，作業也沒有檢討完，希望老師以後能掌握好進度，不要明明就是最後一週上課卻硬要把一整個章節上完，老師趕課很累，同學們理解上也會不太清楚。還有就是，老師如果要利用非正常上課時間進行教學，希望能用非同步遠距的方式，畢竟不是大家在老師開放的時間都有空可以去上課！,"The teacher did not grasp the progress of the class, so he kept rushing to the class and did not finish the homework review. I hope the teacher can grasp the progress in the future. Don’t insist on finishing a whole chapter even though it is the last week of class. The teacher is very tired. , students will not understand clearly. In addition, if the teacher wants to use the non-normal class time for teaching, he hopes to use the asynchronous distance method.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1fba,正課期中考希望記憶跟計算的比例可以平衡一下。希望每次實習報告都可以有回饋，就算很簡短也可以，或是開放寫得比較好的組讓其他人參考，知道助教可能也很忙沒辦法每次都改得很細，但怎麼寫都80上下也不知道要怎麼改進，還有老師每次都強調實習要填分工表，那就應該要確實檢視每組分工狀況再評分吧，寫1/2報告跟寫1/3報告跟只寫心得的人分數一樣合理嗎，還不是一次兩次是幾乎每次，如果整組分數都一樣那填分工的意義在哪，不是說寫很多的人就一定要很高分，但那些不做事的請讓他們明年再來自己做一遍，謝謝,"For the mid-term exam, I hope that the ratio of memorization and calculation can be balanced. I hope that every internship report can have feedback, even if it is very short, or open the well-written group for others to refer to. I know that the teaching assistants may be very busy and cannot make detailed changes every time, but no matter how you write it Around 80, I don’t know how to improve, and the teacher always emphasizes that the internship needs to fill in the division of labor form, so we should really check the status of each group of labor and then score, write 1/2 report and write 1/3 report and only write Is the score of the people with the experience equally reasonable? Isn’t it once or twice almost every time? If the scores of the whole group are the same, what is the significance of filling in the division of labor? It doesn’t mean that people who write a lot must have high scores, but those who don’t do things Please let them come back and do it themselves next year, thanks",999,502,0,1,0.005912184715270996

630cf1c540e337e60fce2016,我認為老師上課比較沒有整理該章節的重點，所以聽起來會覺得沒有邏輯，而且因為每次都講不完，很常出現會讓學生自行讀書得結果，並在考試時常考上課沒有提到的部分。建議老師上課可以提醒學生什麼部分為該章節重點，會讓學生準備考試時壓力不會那麼大。或是調整一學期上課的內容，可以主要抓重點並讓學生理解較好。,"I think the teacher did not sort out the key points of the chapter in class, so it sounds illogical, and because he can’t finish every time, it is very common for students to read the results by themselves, and they often take the exams that are not mentioned in class. part. It is suggested that the teacher can remind students which part is the key point of the chapter in class, so that students will not be so stressed when preparing for the exam.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e11,閱讀文本以及上課時產生的問題都能向老師詢問到有建設性的答案，並且老師提供許多具體的延伸議題和推薦材料，對接觸陌生傳統非常有幫助。,"You can ask the teacher for constructive answers when you read the text and ask questions during class, and the teacher provides many specific extension topics and recommended materials, which are very helpful for getting in touch with unfamiliar traditions.",987,480,0,2,0.9993415474891663
630cf1c440e337e60fce1c6d,課堂上有許多有在自學的學生，因此老師好像會誤會大家的程度。 考試範圍說是兩課實際上都會包含以前的內容， 有些甚至是小東西也不是過去課堂上的重點，這樣的東西出現在期中考上感覺不太像這個程度的人應該會知道的。,"There are many students who are self-studying in class, so the teacher seems to misunderstand everyone's degree. The scope of the exam is that the two courses will actually include the previous content, and some even small things were not the focus of the previous class.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e4a,老師的課非常有趣，讓我覺得桌球非常好玩。我也第一次在人生中學會了如何切球以及很多種的發球方式。尤其是在有一次老師到我們這組與我們練習切球，我剛老師對切了很久，那時候非常開心，覺得有掌握好切球的技術。謝謝老師，雖然因為疫情導致沒辦法上完全部的實體課，但還是非常高興能上到前面的課。,"The teacher's class is very interesting, which makes me think billiards is very fun. I also learned for the first time in my life how to slice and serve in many ways. Especially once the teacher came to our group to practice cutting the ball with us. I just had the teacher cut the ball for a long time. At that time, I was very happy and felt that I had mastered the technique of cutting the ball. Thank you, teacher.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e28,我覺得切球有些太難了，上課講太快有些跟不上。有些同學明顯是很有基礎而來上課的，但另一部份的同學是真的沒有基礎。期中考評分也不太透明。但老師很有耐心！,"I think cutting the ball is a bit too difficult, and I can't keep up with the lectures too fast.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1ead,我覺得老師可以多教一些句子讓我們自己應用，這樣學習效果可能會比照唸課本句子更好,"I think the teacher can teach us some more sentences for us to apply, so that the learning effect may be better than reading the sentences in the textbook",993,486,0,3,0.001482546329498291

630cf1c540e337e60fce1ee2,希望老師可以把目前業界已經不需要的課程內容刪掉，否則只會徒增學生壓力，花費很多心力和時間卻感覺什麼也沒學到。希望老師可以多接納包容一些學生給的建議，隨著時節適當調整課程要求或作業報告份量。希望多一些更具體的規劃相關教學內容，或多分享一些國內外的規劃案例，少一點讓學生很茫然、只能自己上網摸索的報告。老師上課很認真，謝謝老師。,"I hope that the teachers can delete the course content that is no longer needed by the industry, otherwise it will only increase the pressure on the students, and spend a lot of energy and time but feel that they have learned nothing. I hope that teachers can accept more suggestions from some students, and adjust the course requirements or the weight of homework reports appropriately according to the season.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e23,這門課內容豐富充實，老師的講述非常清楚。雖然作業與報告份量很多，但確實學習效果很好。只是，會希望老師能夠按照預定的時間討論每篇個案，例如在三小時課程時間中劃定某段時間專用於討論個案，否則延後討論會讓大家已對於個案內容印象不深。,"The course content is rich and substantial, and the teacher's explanation is very clear. Although there are a lot of assignments and reports, the learning effect is really good.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1f67,一堂令我印象深刻的課程，我覺得老師的上課模式與其他系上老師的教學模式有所不同，是會顛覆我們對民族系的想像。不過我覺得，這也是一種不同的方式來學習與認識民族學，並讓我有所省思。,"A course that impressed me deeply. I think the teacher's teaching mode is different from that of teachers in other departments, which will subvert our imagination of the Department of Ethnic Studies. But I think this is also a different way to learn and understand ethnology, and it makes me reflect.",990,739,0,1,0.9993120431900024
630cf1c540e337e60fce2058,希望老師上課能夠調整方式，而不是只是一直講自己的內容。另外，上課的前二十分鐘可以減少不太必要的談話，謝謝老師。,"I hope that the teacher can adjust the way of class, instead of just talking about his own content all the time.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e1f,老師非常認真教學，對於每一週應教授的內容都有很清楚的先行陳述，並且會於上課時示範動作，再帶領同學揮拍、熟悉動作要領。實際於小組演練時，老師都會在各個組別間巡視，並且適時提出動作的調整，也會一對一帶著同學了解如何操作某些技巧。改成線上同步遠距後，老師給予同學自行觀賞比賽，並且提出問題的機會，讓我們理解比賽的制度進行，以及選手們做出某些動作的原因，鼓勵大家深度思考，並予以解答。雖然在期中考時，不太能理解老師最後的評分方式，但總體而言，是個充實而能學習到桌球基礎知識的課程。,"The teacher is very serious about teaching, and has a very clear statement of the content that should be taught every week, and will demonstrate the movements in class, and then lead the students to swing the racket to familiarize themselves with the essentials of the movements. During the actual group practice, the teacher will patrol among the groups and propose adjustments in time, and will also lead the students one-on-one to understand how to operate certain skills. After changing to online synchronous distance, the teacher gave students the opportunity to watch the game by themselves and ask questions, so that we can understand the system of the game and the reasons why the players make certain actions, and encourage everyone to think deeply and give answers. Although I didn't quite understand the teacher's final grading method during the midterm exam, but overall, it was a fulfilling course that allowed me to learn the basics of billiards.",270,482,0,1,0.9993866682052612

630cf1c540e337e60fce1d9d,覺得老師講得稍微有點快。而有時候，老師放映的投影片似乎會有寄給學生的投影片裡面沒有的東西，讓我很困惑還一直找不到那一頁，結果就錯過了內容。希望老師可以提醒學生這頁要自己拍。,"I think the teacher speaks a little too fast. And sometimes, the slides shown by the teacher seem to have something that is not in the slides sent to the students, which confuses me and I can't find that page, so I miss the content.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1e13,建議：因為這門課的取向是文本閱讀和討論並重，我想老師或可在每週上課後提出若干問題，讓同學在Moodle上回答，藉此引導、鼓勵和督促大家思考跟教學重點相關的問題。 優點：很高興能在畢業前認識老師，這堂課所教的新康德主義流派，部分呼應了我以後研究所要學習的African American Studies (which covers a major bulk of Kant-inspired thought)，而且也是本校哲學系比較特殊的課程，因此非常感謝老師！,"Suggestion: Because the orientation of this course is to place equal emphasis on text reading and discussion, I think the teacher may ask some questions after the class every week, and let the students answer them on Moodle, so as to guide, encourage and urge everyone to think about the teaching points. question. Advantages: I am very happy to know the teacher before graduation.

He hopes to give the radio station more substantive resources, such as lecturers Invitations, grants, etc. In addition, when the epidemic was heating up and the ""distance teaching exercise of the whole school"", the radio station received a notice from the school ""I hope we can broadcast normally"" in the program and news broadcast.

The teacher really values the students' ideas, is super polite to the students, and is also willing to add a lot of extracurricular knowledge in class. I am very happy every time I go to class. Usually the teacher is also very willing to answer students' questions. The interaction between teachers and students is very good, and the scoring method allows students with unsatisfactory test scores to use other methods to increase their scores. Thank you very much. Because this semester is the class from 6. to 9. in the evening, it will not be too late, and the students will leave earlier. This time can also allow students to ask questions. I think the arrangement is very good. I’m really reluctant, is the teacher thinking about teaching other classes? Hahaha, I hope we can meet again this semester.

630cf1c440e337e60fce1cb5,希望老師能多多考慮到非典型的學生，像是僑生、高職生等，他們學過的數理基礎可能跟一般台生的基礎有所不同。也許有些文組生也有類似的感受。另外一些口頭禪像是\這個很簡單吧\、\可以理解吧\、高中都有學過吧\、\這個就是國中數學\等，希望可以減少。因為當對數理基礎差的人來說，不理解的時候，真的無法理解，這類的話可能無法安慰到他們，反而造成一些自我懷疑和小挫折。老師人很好，只是還是想分享一下自己的想法。可能在課程說明那邊要註明一下，要對數理有一定程度的人再來選這門課會較恰當。,"I hope that teachers can give more consideration to atypical students, such as overseas Chinese students and higher vocational students. The basics of mathematics and science they have learned may be different from those of ordinary Taiwanese students. Perhaps some of the literary group students also have similar feelings. Some other mantras are like \This is very simple\, \It is understandable\, I have learned it in high school\, \This is junior high school mathematics\, etc. I hope it can be reduced. Because for people with poor mathematical foundation, when they don’t understand, they really can’t understand. Such words may not comfort them, but cause some self-doubt and small setbacks. The teacher is very nice, but I still want to share my thoughts.

630cf1c440e337e60fce1c45,實習可受益良多，能夠給學生創意發揮的空間，並學習專業技能，但需要投入的時間太多，與所能的得到之學分不成正比，建議可以提升至每學期3學分，另外，既然有學分，就應該適時給予某些技能上的較學資源，像是定期邀請業界講師來教學。讓學生不只是自己摸索。,"Internships can benefit a lot. It can give students room to be creative and learn professional skills, but it takes too much time and is not proportional to the credits they can get.

630cf1c540e337e60fce2037,建議老師可以每次小考完，就進行一次檢討，這樣考不好的同學，也可以重新修正學習方向，不然會越考越爛嗚嗚。,"It is suggested that the teacher can conduct a review after each quiz, so that students who do not pass the test can also correct their study direction, otherwise they will get worse and worse.",343,507,2,1,0.000428617000579834

630cf1c540e337e60fce1fe4,車車老師這學期考量到現代學生的閱讀習慣，因此不拿沒有句讀的原典給大家當作教材閱讀。老師會製作自己的講義，結合學者的串講，讓大家更加了解詩經的古今義詮釋，有無教化作用的渲染色彩等等。本來有三次小考，但考量到疫情遠距的因素就只有考到一次，我認為老師十分關心學生，能給考不好的同學，有補救的機會，並且當週無法出席的同學，老師也會給予補考，真的非常佛心。只是在講課的時候，或許可以帶入影音資料的分享或是讓同學上台報告之類的，也許能改善比較一成不變的上課風格。車車老師的課令人獲益良多。,"Teacher Che Che has considered the reading habits of modern students this semester, so he does not use the original texts without sentences as textbooks for everyone to read. The teacher will make his own handouts, combined with the lectures of scholars, so that everyone can better understand the interpretation of the ancient and modern meanings of the Book of Songs, the rendering of colors with or without enlightening effect, and so on. There were originally three small exams, but considering the distance of the epidemic, only one exam was passed. I think the teacher cares about the students very much, and can give students who fail the exam a chance to make up for it. Make-up exams will be given, which is really very Buddhist. It’s just that during the lectures, it may be possible to bring in the sharing of audio-visual materials or let the students report on stage, which may improve the relatively static class style. Teacher Che Che's class is very beneficial.",1000,496,0,2,0.9983586668968201

630cf1c540e337e60fce1f8f,整個學期就只學了拜日式和樹式，大約有一個多月都在做一樣的東西，之後就遠距了所以不確定有無其他安排。但光是講期中要考的就講了三週，每週都以為他終於要考試，而且他本來說要考拜日式，結果後來直接突襲考樹式，我真的看不動這一波操作。 第一次上到令人這麼不愉快的瑜珈課，老師很愛一直講話，不如拿這個時間帶我們做其他瑜珈動作。上課有規定衣著，建議同學想清楚再選課，整體來說很不推，我寧願花錢去外面上更好的瑜珈課。我都有好好上課，期中考也考得很順利，所以我真的是誠心在這裡告誡同學。,"I only learned sun salutation and tree pose for the whole semester. I have been doing the same thing for more than a month, and then I am far away, so I am not sure if there are other arrangements. But it took three weeks just to talk about the mid-term exam. Every week, he thought he would finally take the exam, and he originally said he would take the sun salutation exam, but then he went straight to the tree exam. I really can't stand this wave of operations . This is the first time I have such an unpleasant yoga class, the teacher loves to talk all the time, why not use this time to take us to do other yoga movements. There is a dress code for classes, and I suggest students think carefully before choosing classes. Overall, I don’t recommend it. I would rather spend money to go to a better yoga class outside. I have attended classes well, and the midterm exams have gone well, so I really sincerely warn my classmates here.",592,494,0,1,0.019488275051116943
630cf1c540e337e60fce2036,老師人很好，但是希望上課不要讓同學一個一個唸答案，覺得有點耗時間，把時間拿去補充更多日本文化知識會更好。,"The teacher is very nice, but I hope that the students will not have to read the answers one by one in class.

630cf1c540e337e60fce2054,感謝老師的教導！上完老師所授課的部分後，我認為實體上課的時候老師可以將PPT裡的文字放大一些，不要一頁放那麼多個項目，這樣離投影幕較遠的同學會看不到PPT文字。還有，有時候PPT背景顏色會影響文字的清晰度，也請老師日後注意。,"Thanks for the teacher's teaching! After finishing the part taught by the teacher, I think the teacher can enlarge the text in the PPT during the physical class, and don’t put so many items on one page, so that students who are far away from the projection screen will not be able to see the PPT text.

It feels like I didn’t plan it well at the beginning and then I thought about it and then I asked my classmates to add it. For example: me-change The video file provided at the beginning of the period was stipulated to be 8-10 minutes, but it was changed to 8-12 minutes three weeks before the report; another example: the original report content did not stipulate that the report content should give suggestions to classmates, create mottos, etc., and count them before class. Zhou also didn't mention it, but added additional requirements 3 weeks before the report.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1f94,改成開書考後題目太多而時間太少，再加上每道題都有一定難度，要在這堂課取得高分並不是件易事。,"There are too many questions and too little time after changing to the open book test, and each question has a certain degree of difficulty. It is not easy to get a high score in this class.",343,507,2,1,0.0005071163177490234
630cf1c640e337e60fce20ff,很喜歡老師的規實課 可以說是第一次在規實學到這麼多 跟這麼專心參與課程內容 希望老師能夠從制度上盡可能的改變現有規實的許多問題 多教一些這種促進學生思考及訓練規劃能力的課。,I really like the teacher's practical class. It can be said that it is the first time that I have learned so much in practice and participated in the course content so attentively. I hope that the teacher can change the existing practice as much as possible from the system.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2267,語言學有夠難，希望老師也能調整考試範圍和難度，我們沒有那麼聰明…… 老師很認真上課，有時候蠻有趣的，但功課報告和考試加起來讓期末生不如死,"Linguistics is difficult enough, I hope the teacher can also adjust the scope and difficulty of the exam, we are not that smart... The teacher is very serious in class, sometimes it is quite interesting, but the combination of homework reports and exams makes life worse than death at the end of the semester",231,553,3,1,0.0003896355628967285
630cf1c640e337e60fce21c0,老師教導的邏輯真的是太棒了，但是覺得學校一個TA都不給老師真的好可惜，不然我們就有作業可以寫，老師也不會改考卷改的那麼辛苦了。,"The logic taught by the teacher is really great, but I feel that it is a pity that the school does not give the teacher a TA, otherwise we would have homework to write, and the teacher would not have to work so hard to correct the test papers.",1012,746,0,1,0.001792311668395996

630cf1c640e337e60fce20d9,考試與報告真的太多了，且每個考試與報告都相當花時間，老師說題目不難，但其實每個題目都需要搜集很多資料，而且也不太清楚應該於哪個平台搜集資料比較好（因為課程內容與平時較為不同），光是寫期中考卷就用掉五天的時間（例如需要看完8小時以上的影片才能作答），尚有個人報告、小組報告、期末報告、期末考，強烈壓縮其餘課程複習時間。且此科目為師培中心規定必修，在其餘科目衝堂下很多人都只能選這堂課，並非多數人都擅長或對此堂課很有興趣，希望老師可以調整一下作業與考試。,"There are really too many exams and reports, and each exam and report takes a lot of time. The teacher said that the questions are not difficult, but in fact, each question requires a lot of data collection, and it is not clear which platform should be used to collect data. (Because the content of the course is different from usual), it takes five days to write the midterm exam paper (for example, you need to watch more than 8 hours of video to answer), and there are individual reports, group reports, final reports, and final exams. Strongly compress the rest of the course review time. Moreover, this subject is required by the teacher training center. Many people can only take this course under the other subjects. Not most of them are good at or very interested in this course. I hope the teacher can adjust the assignments and exams.",1013,747,0,3,0.0006352066993713379
630cf1c640e337e60fce2134,希望老師能多補充一些東西，大部分學到的都是靠自己摸索也不知道是不是對的,"I hope the teacher can add something more, most of what I learned is based on my own exploration and I don’t know if it’s right",1014,526,0,1,0.00950688123703003
630cf1c640e337e60fce20f8,很感謝宇庭老師這學期的教導，每次的project都有先給予明確的說明，讓學生能有跡可循操做出相近的結果，同時也有達到獨立思考的訓練！,"I am very grateful to Teacher Yu Ting for his teaching this semester.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2190,我覺得課程內容非常艱澀，報告的負擔也有點重，但老師都很願意提供同學幫助，也非常彈性。建議老師務必要把同學報告的書籍設為指定參考書！在準備報告的過程中常常遇到書借不到的狀況，要再自己多跑其他圖書館找書。,"I think the content of the course is very difficult, and the burden of the report is a bit heavy, but the teachers are very willing to provide students with help, and they are very flexible. It is recommended that the teacher must set the books reported by the students as the designated reference books! In the process of preparing reports, I often encounter the situation that books cannot be borrowed, and I have to go to other libraries to find books by myself.",1015,747,0,2,0.997730553150177

630cf1c640e337e60fce20fd,很幸運可以在最後一學期的規實遇到安廷老師，讓被規實折磨到完全不想走本行的我稍微開始找回對規劃的興趣。希望老師可以把這堂課整個大改革，把不貼合現在業界需求的課程內容刪掉，多加入一些能夠真正讓學生學到專業能力的內容。希望多一點具體的教學、多分享國內外的規劃案例，少一點讓學生很茫然、只能靠自己上網摸索的報告。在老師的課上學到很多，謝謝老師，希望未來學弟妹的規實能好過一點QQ。,"I was very lucky to meet Mr. An Ting in the final semester, which made me, who was tortured by the practice, not want to go to my profession at all, to start to regain my interest in planning. I hope that the teacher can make a major reform of this class, delete the course content that does not meet the current needs of the industry, and add more content that can truly enable students to learn professional skills. I hope that there will be more specific teaching, more sharing of planning cases at home and abroad, and fewer reports that make students feel at a loss and can only rely on the Internet to explore by themselves.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2269,課堂報告時間太長，蠻多堂課都是學生報告時間佔去兩個小時，與其聽同學報告這麼久，會希望教授自己講更清處。,"The class report time is too long. In many classes, the student report time takes up two hours.

630cf1c640e337e60fce21ad,老師在學期一開始就先行遠距，很謝謝老師。而且同步上課再加上影片對這們課很有幫助，聽不太懂得隨時可以回去聽多遍一些。,"The teacher went far away at the beginning of the semester, thank you very much teacher.

630cf1c540e337e60fce2082,希望老師上課不要只是念講義，希望能用白版解釋。也希望老師出的小考能與範圍相符合，很多題都不在課本範圍內，題目問題也定義不清楚,"I hope that the teacher will not just read the handouts in class, and hope that he can use the white board to explain.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2102,就像是之前討論所提及的，有些課程應該是要在開學的時候先建立相關概念，且這學期很多時程都略顯倉促，希望之後都能有更好的相關課程規劃。,"As mentioned in the previous discussion, some courses should establish related concepts at the beginning of the semester, and many schedules this semester are a little rushed. I hope that there will be better related course planning in the future.",475,526,0,1,0.00034558773040771484
630cf1c640e337e60fce2121,老師有時候問問題會發散出去，找不到重點，其他還好。,"Sometimes when the teacher asks questions, they will spread out and can't find the key points. Others are fine.",1020,533,0,1,0.9892740845680237
630cf1c640e337e60fce2122,若是需要每一個客戶都有組別做的話，可以一開始就講清楚，或者規劃一下如何安排最恰當，看是要先登記先贏還是一開始就猜拳，因為後續不管用甚麼方式安排都會讓人覺得不甚公平。 上課內容讓學生感覺無所適從，如果還是一樣用基礎公關的理論來講，會讓人覺得不是很必要，到了學期末還是不太清楚公關企劃跟行銷企劃到底有哪些差異？或許在課綱的安排上老師可以再想一下學生到底想聽什麼。,"If it is necessary for each customer to have a group, you can make it clear at the beginning, or plan how to arrange it most appropriately, to see whether to register first to win first or to guess at the beginning, because no matter what method is used in the follow-up arrangement, people will be disappointed. I don't think it's fair. The content of the class makes students feel at a loss. If we still use the basic public relations theory, it will make people feel that it is not necessary. At the end of the semester, we still don’t know the difference between public relations planning and marketing planning.

630cf1c540e337e60fce1f8d,老師講解清楚，讓我對於瑜珈有更全面且正確的認識，只是在聽老師講解扣分規則時我有點小緊張跟擔心，因為自己抓到動作的速度比較慢，柔軟度比較差也無法一次就抓到自己能做到的動作應該長怎麼樣才正確，有時候會很害怕因此被老師認為是上課不專心而被扣分，幸好最後感覺都沒有發生這樣的狀況XD,"The teacher explained clearly, which gave me a more comprehensive and correct understanding of yoga, but I was a little nervous and worried when listening to the teacher's explanation of the deduction rules, because the speed of catching the movements was relatively slow, and the softness was relatively poor, so I couldn't do it all at once. What should I look like when I catch the movements I can do? Sometimes I am afraid that the teacher will think that I am not paying attention in class and I will be deducted points.

630cf1c640e337e60fce20d7,老師在領域中相當專業！認真聽講可以學到很多很豐富的內容，都是很長期累積的研究，不過因為課程沒有提供講義或是簡報等等，所以上課時有些難記憶，另外作業份量也有點大，不過老師很溫柔都可以讓我們有討論的空間！,"The teacher is quite professional in the field! You can learn a lot of rich content by listening carefully. It is a long-term accumulation of research. However, because the course does not provide handouts or presentations, it is difficult to remember in class. In addition, the homework is a bit heavy, but the teacher is very gentle.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2124,廣告系莫名的必修，會不知道為什麼而做企劃，然後上課又沒有講得很清楚公關到底在做啥,"The Department of Advertising is inexplicably compulsory. I do planning without knowing why, and then I didn’t explain clearly what PR is doing in class.",1020,533,0,1,0.0006700754165649414
630cf1c640e337e60fce2123,感覺課程的扎實度跟上學期的廣企相比有點落差，使學生在做期末提案報告或參加競賽沒有釐清廣告企畫案跟公關的不同，導致準備方向有點錯亂。,"I feel that the solidity of the course is a little bit lower than that of Guangzhou Enterprises in the previous semester, so that students did not clarify the difference between advertising planning and public relations when they were making final proposal reports or participating in competitions, which led to a bit of confusion in the direction of preparation.",1020,533,0,1,0.0003145933151245117

I really like the teacher's courses, teaching methods and comments on the report. I think it is very constructive and useful. I have learned a lot and I like the teacher's style very much, but I hope The two teachers can agree on the teaching direction and ideas, or at least have discussed with each other about the course content, so that students will not often feel that Teacher A asks to do this, but Teacher B may ask to change it when commenting. something like this happens",475,526,0,1,0.9994068145751953

630cf1c640e337e60fce217e,老師對課程進度沒有良好的掌握，導致每週課後作業無法順利檢討完成。而且課後作業的難度跨幅大，對剛學習日文的同學來說有點吃力。且期中期末考試經常超出範圍，有許多課程上沒教過的生字。老師也不太回信，導致臨時有事情想請教老師都找不到人。 我覺得老師在整個課程的安排上還有再進步的空間。,"The teacher did not have a good grasp of the progress of the course, which resulted in the failure to review and complete the weekly homework. Moreover, the difficulty of the after-school homework spans a large range, which is a bit difficult for students who are just learning Japanese. And the mid-term and final exams often exceed the scope, and there are many new words that have not been taught in the course. The teacher didn't reply too much, so I couldn't find anyone who wanted to ask the teacher for a temporary matter. I think the teacher still has room for further improvement in the arrangement of the entire course.",27,511,0,1,0.0004769563674926758
630cf1c640e337e60fce21e8,上學期有購買一本句型練習冊但這學期沒有繼續使用有點可惜。老師除了使用課本也有另外影印補充教材，但偶爾補充教材的內容會超出初級日語的課程範圍，考量到會話課需要兼具實用所以感覺是不可避免的，考試也不會為難大家，都是以課本內容為主！老師很關心學生，考前也會詢問大家考試範圍能否負擔，是溫暖又有耐心的老師！,"I bought a sentence pattern workbook last semester, but it is a pity that I didn't continue to use it this semester. In addition to using the textbook, the teacher also photocopied supplementary teaching materials, but occasionally the content of the supplementary teaching materials will exceed the scope of the elementary Japanese course. Considering that the conversation class needs to be practical at the same time, it feels inevitable, and the exam will not embarrass everyone. It is all based on textbooks. Content matters! The teacher cares about the students very much. Before the exam, he will ask everyone whether the exam range can be afforded. He is a warm and patient teacher!",66,511,0,1,0.9958168864250183

630cf1c640e337e60fce2281,老師教的應該算是傳統（或說本格）的新聞攝影，對於照片有特定形式要求，自己是否適合就見仁見智。老師很認真，分享很多實務上的豐富經驗，會仔細檢討每位同學的作業，這部分收穫最大。作業量我覺得還算輕鬆，但集中在學期前段，希望可以分散些，還有增加類別（這學期拍好多圖文QQ）。,"What the teacher taught should be regarded as traditional (or original) photojournalism. There are specific requirements for photos, and it is up to everyone whether they are suitable or not. The teacher is very serious, sharing a lot of practical experience, and will carefully review each student's homework, which is the most rewarding part. I think the amount of homework is relatively easy, but it is concentrated in the first part of the semester. I hope it can be dispersed and more categories can be added (a lot of pictures and texts on QQ this semester).",1021,543,0,3,0.9994144439697266

630cf1c640e337e60fce20fe,老師教學認真，對於都市計畫、土地資源等都有很多想法，教學風氣也十分不錯，但很多時候會希望老師可以提前先跟學生說自己期望的作品要以什麼方式呈現，而不是在全班報告完畢後才用較激動的情緒評論大家的作品，雖然這些評論很貼切很實際，但還是希望可以提早更多講授美學、設計、排版或是諸如此類的注意事項，若能提前講授海報、作品冊等的設計技巧，會更增加大家學習努力的動力，否則事後才批評容易讓大家覺得很氣餒。,"The teacher is serious in teaching, has many ideas about urban planning, land resources, etc., and the teaching atmosphere is also very good, but many times I hope that the teacher can tell the students in advance how to present the work he expects, instead of telling the whole class After the report is over, I will comment on everyone's works with more excitement. Although these comments are very appropriate and practical, I still hope that I can teach more about aesthetics, design, typography or other precautions in advance. If I can teach posters and portfolios in advance Such design skills will increase everyone's motivation to study hard, otherwise criticism after the fact will easily make everyone feel very discouraged.",475,526,0,1,0.9911075234413147

630cf1c640e337e60fce2137,老師上課都會鼓勵同學發言，也會針對同學的問題提供更深入引導，也很認真評價同學的分組報告，是十分認真的老師，辛苦了！ 但可能不太習慣老師的講課方式，或是因受限於大一尚未具備基礎知識，課程內容無法更深入，導致有時候上完會不太知道自己到底學到了什麼。 （老師上課時有時會不小心冒出太多之類的、等等、這樣子就會...一些東西...語助詞，有時候其實無法很好理解具體是什麼就過去了，導致沒有真正理解。）,"The teacher will encourage the students to speak in class, and will provide more in-depth guidance on the students' problems, and also seriously evaluate the group reports of the students. He is a very serious teacher, hard work! However, you may not be used to the teacher's lecture method, or because you do not have the basic knowledge in the freshman year, the course content cannot be further in-depth, so sometimes you don't know what you have learned after the class.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2261,幾乎每堂課都讓同學上台報告上課內容，教授負責補充跟糾正，然後剩下時間給助教小考或檢討考卷。這學期七組報告兩次，一次課程內容一次自選主題。 這種上課方式建議考慮是否要捨棄。首先同學不一定能完整正確地預習並呈現課程內容；再來同學畢竟不是每個都會教人，每次報告品質參差不齊，有些同學只是念稿，有些解釋不清不楚導致大家學習成效有限；最後，我不覺得教授沒有備課，因為她有PPT跟影片，但這樣的上課模式真的沒辦法說服多數人。 可能教授本意是想讓我們活用知識，但其實大家私底下都不喜歡。,"In almost every class, students are asked to come to the stage to report on the content of the class, and the professor is responsible for making additions and corrections, and then the remaining time is for the teaching assistants to take quizzes or review the test papers. In this semester, seven groups report twice, one course content and one self-selected topic. It is recommended to consider whether to give up this way of teaching. First of all, students may not be able to completely and correctly preview and present the course content; secondly, not all students are good at teaching, and the quality of each report is uneven. Some students just read the manuscript, and some do not explain clearly. ;Finally, I don't think the professor didn't prepare lessons, because she has PPT and videos, but this kind of class mode really can't convince most people. Maybe the professor wanted us to use knowledge flexibly, but in fact, everyone didn't like it in private.",231,553,3,1,0.0003345012664794922

630cf1c640e337e60fce2263,請助教出考卷的成效沒有到很好，因為他們並不知道課程內容、不知道課程重點，所以出的考卷會和課程內容接軌不到。整學期聽教授授課的時間很短，很希望老師能多運用自己的專業知識來講課，畢竟這是助教和學生不足的。 希望老師真的能考量減少報告及考試內容量，不然真的有些分身乏術，謝謝老師。,"The effect of asking teaching assistants to produce test papers is not very good, because they do not know the course content and the key points of the course, so the test papers produced will not be in line with the course content. The time to listen to the professor's lectures throughout the semester is very short. I really hope that the teacher can use his professional knowledge to give lectures. After all, this is a shortage of teaching assistants and students.

I hope that the mid-term report can be in the form of a group. It is difficult for a freshman to write a 5,000-word report. In addition, you should not give more than 90 points because you did not report on stage, because Not everyone has the opportunity to be on stage, and not everyone has the opportunity to speak at the MAC, so those who have the opportunity to speak or report should be given additional points. But to support the teacher to conduct the mid-term exam in the way of film experience, the pressure will not be so great. In addition, if you want to use online teaching, you should send a letter at least 1 hour before class, otherwise commuting students will make a waste of time. Finally, I would like to thank the teacher for his teaching in the first 2/3 semesters, thank you for your hard work.",1002,743,0,1,0.000855565071105957

When writing a business plan, we can only refer to the lecture notes of last semester’s marketing planning class and the steps we did last semester. Then I don’t know why I need to take this class this semester, and I don’t know the difference between public relations and marketing. where. In addition, I think that since the public relations course of this semester coincides with the proposal competition, it would be better for the whole class to participate in the competition, and there is no need to invite other companies to come, let alone force students to fail to participate in the competition in order to let students work for these companies .",1020,533,0,1,0.0029479265213012695

It is suggested that teachers can adjust the depth of the course, or designate students to read certain texts before class, which will help students understand the course content. In addition, in the case of three reports in one semester, it is still necessary to bear such a large amount of mid-term and final homework. (Because the topic is too large, students need to consult a lot of information, which will cause a certain degree of burden) I hope that it can be adjusted accordingly.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2268,我認為這學期的語言學內容比起上學期基礎知識內容更深，也期望教授可以多加解釋且帶著學生做練習題，但並沒有。我能理解教授希望學生上台報告是可以在報告同時更理解章節內容，但在台下聽的同學不一定能了解，畢竟台上報告者也不是語言學專家，傻眼的是正當我以為教授會接著講解報告過的章節時，那些章節卻被認為是已經教過了，請其他教授來演講也是，演講過的地方老師也不會講解了，這樣根本等同於我們在自學。還有考完小考後每次都是助教簡單帶過檢討或把答案發至信箱，到最後學生還是一知半解...,"I think the linguistic content of this semester is deeper than the basic knowledge content of the previous semester, and I also expect the professor to explain more and take the students to do exercises, but they don't. I can understand that the professor hopes that the students can better understand the content of the chapter while giving the report, but the students listening in the audience may not be able to understand it. After all, the speaker on the stage is not a linguistic expert. I was dumbfounded because I thought the professor would continue When explaining the chapters that have been reported, those chapters are considered to have been taught, and it is the same to invite other professors to give lectures, and the local teachers who have lectured will not explain it. This is basically equivalent to self-study. Also, every time after the quiz, the teaching assistant simply took the review or sent the answer to the mailbox. In the end, the students still didn't know much...",231,553,3,1,0.000451505184173584

630cf1c640e337e60fce229e,Judy非常親切！這堂課學到超級實用的英文說法，是平時自己比較少接觸的，因此覺得收穫良多。雖然ETP fun time準備的很辛苦，但身為觀眾在玩別組設計的遊戲時真的超有趣！除此之外，Me-change project 也是個挺有意思的活動，可以督促自己完成一個目標。,"Judy is very kind! In this class, I learned super practical English expressions, which I rarely come into contact with, so I feel that I have gained a lot.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2264,我認為老師真的是一個很為學生著想的老師，只是在這學期的其中一個教學方式即讓各組報告課本內容的部分，我認為可以改善改善。雖然目的是讓學生可以自主學習以及讓大家可以有實戰的經驗，可是會導致大家有許多關於知識部分的重疊，或許下一年可以延續學期末的自選主題報告，可是或許可以改善課本內容報告方面的教學方式。謝謝老師！辛苦了！,"I think the teacher is really a teacher who is very considerate of the students, but one of the teaching methods this semester is to let each group report on the content of the textbook, I think it can be improved. Although the purpose is to allow students to learn independently and to allow everyone to have practical experience, it will lead to a lot of overlap in the knowledge part.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2209,ppt呈現方式容易讓人不知道上到哪、忘記今天的主題是什麼。且內容繁雜，有點填鴨式教學,"The ppt presentation method makes it easy for people to not know where to go and forget what the theme of today is. And the content is complicated, a bit cramming teaching",1025,752,0,1,0.012443065643310547

630cf1c640e337e60fce2282,課程是「新聞攝影」，卻有很大一部份的課程內容不是攝影技術本身，雖然課綱有寫，而我當初選課沒注意到，是我自己的問題，但仍希望未來課程內容能專注於攝影，因為傳院已有其他版面編輯課程、新聞採訪寫作課程，會選這門課應該都是希望學攝影。 關於成績評量，我一直覺得很不透明，各週有什麼作業、作業算不算分、怎麼算分、期末專題怎麼算分、出席成績怎麼記等都不清楚，如果之後對於期末成績有疑慮，恐怕也難爭辯。,"The course is ""Photojournalism"", but a large part of the course content is not photography itself. Although the syllabus is written, I didn't notice it when I chose the course. It is my own problem, but I still hope that the course content can be focused As for photography, because there are other layout editing courses and news interview and writing courses in Chuanyuan, the reason for taking this course is probably because they want to learn photography. Regarding the grade evaluation, I have always felt that it is very opaque. It is not clear what homework is given each week, whether the assignment is counted, how to calculate the grade, how to calculate the grade for the final project, and how to record the attendance. If you have doubts about the final grade later, I am afraid. It's also hard to argue.",1021,543,0,3,0.017105579376220703

630cf1c640e337e60fce221b,老師教得很清楚，且會吧比較複雜的部分解釋幾遍，老師也很樂意解決學生的疑問。老師的英文說得很容易聽得懂。另外，每週也會複習上週教的，這樣對學生來說應該很有幫助！,"The teacher teaches very clearly and will explain the more complicated parts several times.

630cf1c640e337e60fce21c6,很喜歡教授的上課方式，清楚，而且會示範一些實際應用的情況，並且叮嚀常見的錯誤，作為一個完全沒有學過哲學的學生，也能跟得上教學進度。 可以理解教授因為助教不足，所以在考卷批改上以效率為主，但這樣的計分方式滿有壓力的，希望教授可以多提供一點加分的機會。,"I really like the professor's way of teaching, it is clear, and he will demonstrate some practical applications, and remind common mistakes. As a student who has never studied philosophy, he can still keep up with the teaching progress. It is understandable that the professor focuses on efficiency in grading exam papers due to insufficient teaching assistants, but such a scoring method is full of pressure.

I don’t know whether it is as long as there is attendance, there will be a certain score, or if there are a lot of words or rich content to get a high score.

630cf1c640e337e60fce219a,這學期多了podcast逐字稿填空的作業，內容生活化，有些與時事結合，讓學生除了課本知識也能學習時下常用的日文。作業的份量對在上初級日語的同學來說可能需要花點心思，而且為了顧及課本進度這份作業不會馬上檢討，建議可以改成兩週一次作業，大家比較不會檢討時都忘記作業內容了。整體而言老師很願意和學生討論，作業內容也會參考同學提出的意見，上課活潑有趣！,"This semester, there are more podcast verbatim assignments to fill in the blanks. The content is life-like, and some are combined with current events, so that students can learn Japanese commonly used nowadays in addition to textbook knowledge. The amount of homework may require a little thought for students who are studying elementary Japanese, and in order to take into account the progress of the textbook, this homework will not be reviewed immediately. It is recommended to change it to a biweekly homework, so that everyone will not forget the content of the homework during the review up. Generally speaking, the teacher is willing to discuss with the students, and the content of the homework will also refer to the opinions of the students. The class is lively and interesting!",27,511,0,1,0.9959903359413147

630cf1c640e337e60fce2266,1.講授時間極少：一星期不超過一小時。若要學生自讀那辛苦通勤前來教室上課意義何在？ 2.考完試不是不檢討就是委託助教草率檢討 3.請學生對同學的報告提出問題卻沒有在該期中考試範圍考試前進行解答 讓學生不禁懷疑提問是否只是走個過場，讓學生覺得教授好像有在做事？ 4.以是否提問為評分方式一環十分不合理，學生不主動提問原因眾多，例如：對課程內容沒有疑問、腦中想問的問題已經有其他同學提出並得到解答。 5.若教授認為以提問為評分方式能增加學生課堂參與度，那可真是令人擔憂。,"1. Minimal lecture time: no more than one hour a week. What's the point of commuting to the classroom if students read by themselves? 2. Either do not review after the exam or entrust teaching assistants to review hastily 3. Ask students to ask questions about their classmates’ reports but fail to answer them before the mid-term exam. Are you doing something? 4. It is very unreasonable to use whether to ask questions as a part of the scoring method. There are many reasons why students do not ask questions actively, for example: they have no doubts about the course content, and the questions they want to ask have already been asked and answered by other students. 5.

630cf1c640e337e60fce234d,建議老師少講一點主題，把重點聚焦，例如花一堂課好好講R、一堂課GIS、一堂課excel ，重點有點太分散了。此外，報告的內容、要求可以講詳細一點，不然同學也不知道要做甚麼內容，很容易失焦。,"It is recommended that the teacher talk less about the topic and focus on the key points. For example, spend one class on R, one class on GIS, and one class on excel. The focus is a bit too scattered.

630cf1c740e337e60fce2405,覺得這是一堂可以讓本來就有行銷底的同學有學理裝備的一堂課；但是對於沒有改念，要從0到1的同學就很難有太多收穫（尤其是跟沒有底的同學一組的時候，有底子的同學真的頭有點痛......）,"I think this is a class that can equip students who already have a marketing background; but for students who have not changed their reading and want to go from 0 to 1, it is difficult to gain much (especially in a group with students who have no background).

630cf1c640e337e60fce234c,很輕鬆的課，老師在這堂課人超好還很會跟同學互動，只是我其實期待學到更多更深入的人口學知識，感覺上完這堂課還是知道皮毛而已，沒有太深入的了解，但老師有帶大家使用Excel操作還蠻實用的。也希望老師對於期中期末報告可以有更明確的說明，不是只是一兩句話以蔽之，雖然這樣可能是給學生比較多發揮空間啦，但也會讓人無所適從,"It's a very relaxing class. The teacher is super nice and good at interacting with the students in this class, but I actually look forward to learning more and more in-depth knowledge of demographics. I feel that after this class, I still know the superficial knowledge, not too deep I understand, but it is quite practical for the teacher to show you how to use Excel.

630cf1c740e337e60fce2418,建議老師在第一堂課直接將學生進行能力分級測驗來配對練習夥伴，不用採自願的方式因為大家也不好意思主動提出要換夥伴。很喜歡老師的課，可以運動到很多，希望老師下一個學期會開羽球高級，一定會給老師捧場。,"It is suggested that the teacher directly assigns the students an ability grading test to match the practice partners in the first class, instead of using a voluntary method, because everyone is too embarrassed to take the initiative to change partners.

630cf1c640e337e60fce219e,這學期增加Podcast內容我覺得很好，但在課堂進度安排上希望能掌握得更好一點。此外，也要避免一句話重複講很多次，也很常講到一半又跳去講別的事，有時跟不上老師的邏輯。,"I think it's good to add podcast content this semester, but I hope to have a better grasp of the class schedule.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2237,沒上過任何創業或設計思考的課程，但透過老師的教學步驟也能慢慢進到提案發想跟企劃的過程，老師也邀請許多業師分享自身經驗，雖然需要在有限的時間內完成完整且可行的提案真的非常疲憊，但真的推薦對創業或設計思考有興趣的可以來修這門課，也可以遇到很多很有想法的人！,"I haven't taken any courses on entrepreneurship or design thinking, but through the teacher's teaching steps, I can slowly enter the process of proposal development and planning. The teacher also invites many industry teachers to share their own experience.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2275,我覺得老師上課內容非常豐富，也在HW跟project學到很多，但可能因為我自己是大學部的，有時候寫作業或複習起來比較吃力一點，要一直寄信跟老師或助教問有點不好意思也不太效率，不知道老師或助教未來是否願意成立一個Line群組之類的，讓同學有問題可以直接和助教或老師，我之前修中會的時候助教就有開群組，學習效率提升很多。另外建議老師Project跟HW4的期限可以稍微錯開，那週期末剛好很多，一起交壓力很大。,"I think the content of the teacher’s class is very rich, and I also learned a lot from HW and the project, but maybe because I am a university student, sometimes it is a bit difficult to do homework or review, and I feel a little embarrassed to keep sending letters to the teacher or teaching assistant. It’s also not very efficient. I don’t know if the teacher or teaching assistants are willing to set up a Line group in the future, so that students can directly contact the teaching assistants or teachers if they have questions. When I was in the middle school, the teaching assistants opened groups, and the learning efficiency was improved. a lot of. In addition, it is suggested that the deadlines of the teacher's Project and HW4 can be slightly staggered, and the end of the period is just a lot, and the pressure of handing in together is very high.",169,546,3,3,0.0023086071014404297

630cf1c640e337e60fce22cd,老師教學認真，我確實學到許多，另外希望能多講一些攝影手法，或分享作品，學期末段同學作業檢討有點占太長的時間，或許能挪到課後再個別討論，此外，希望能平均分配能讓每個人都檢討到。,"The teacher is serious in teaching, and I really learned a lot. I also hope to talk more about photography techniques or share works. The homework review at the end of the semester is a bit too long. Maybe it can be discussed after class.

630cf1c640e337e60fce22e1,這學期學到英文很多以往不同的表達方式(包括俗語阿等等的)也加強了自己的寫作技巧。不過這次的be a new me有太多需要做人際拓展的部分(要採訪別人之類的)我覺得老師可以一開始在課堂上就幫我們分好組互相採訪，在認識的人面前應該可以更好進行英文交流，也比較不會那麼尷尬。,"This semester, I learned many different expressions in English (including colloquialisms, etc.) and strengthened my writing skills. But this time be a new me has too many parts that need to do interpersonal development (interviewing others and so on). I think the teacher can help us divide into groups and interview each other from the beginning of the class. It should be better in front of people we know. It is easier to communicate in English, and it is less embarrassing.",899,531,3,3,0.019724249839782715
630cf1c640e337e60fce22ce,因為上課多是理論教學，但理論內容很多與實作相關，如果配合實作可能印象更深刻，所以覺得課堂上有共同操作的練習時間會更好,"Because the class is mostly theoretical teaching, but a lot of theoretical content is related to practice.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2334,選到兩漢經學真的非常開心！課程內容紮實，老師還自製講義、找相關影片，讓課堂不只有老師獨自講述，另外會與同學互動討論，太用心了。可以當作甲班大一國學導讀進階課程。,"I am really happy to have chosen Han Confucianism! The content of the course is solid, and the teacher also made handouts and found related videos, so that the class is not only taught by the teacher alone, but also interactively discussed with the students, which is very attentive.

630cf1c640e337e60fce235d,老師上課的內容很有趣，不會太難但又可以學到東西，外系的同學修起來應該不會有負擔。但是希望老師能多上一點內容，每次上課都沒有達到三小時，我覺得有點可惜。然後老師上課問問題都沒人理，我其實很想回答，但是每次都不敢（慫），老師搞不好可以考慮用點名的方式，或是回答加分的方式讓同學回答看看，如果有人先開始回答，可能就會增加其他人回答的動機。,"The content of the teacher's class is very interesting. It is not too difficult but you can learn something. Students from other departments should not be burdened to study. But I hope the teacher can give more content. I think it's a pity that each class does not reach three hours. Then the teacher asked questions in class and no one responded. I really wanted to answer, but I didn’t dare to (counseling) every time. Maybe the teacher could consider using roll call, or giving students points for answering.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2389,我能感受到老師很認真為我們好，但是同時用電腦教R語言跟用黑板教統計知識，真的很難在上課時兼顧兩者，而且由於時間的限制，老師教R的時候常常直接把程式碼打出來卻沒有解釋為何要這樣打，教統計知識的時候有點小亂，常常跳來跳去，有些部分解釋得很完整，有些卻只解釋了ㄧ些，然後作業很多QAQ。,"I can feel that the teacher is serious about helping us, but at the same time, it is really difficult to use the computer to teach the R language and the blackboard to teach statistics. The program code is typed out but there is no explanation why it is done this way. When teaching statistics, it is a bit messy, and it often jumps around.

630cf1c740e337e60fce2401,分組報告時，可以自由選擇組員，助於學生做出更好的報告內容，過程也更加愉快。 希望老師可以給予更多的報告回饋，這樣學生才知道在哪些部分可以做得更好，即使feedback有些harsh也沒關係，因為這樣才會進步，又或是可以在課後給予等等。,"When reporting in groups, you can freely choose group members, which will help students make better report content and make the process more enjoyable. I hope the teacher can give more report feedback, so that students can know which parts they can do better, even if the feedback is harsh, it doesn’t matter, because this will make progress, or can be given after class, etc.",272,557,0,1,0.031793177127838135
630cf1c640e337e60fce227b,這堂課是我在政大修過最有收穫的一門課，雖然課程內容對我而言難度過高，缺乏許多先備知識，但老師藉由整合理論與程式實作，讓我瞭解衍生性商品的運用，甚至可成為為未來工作時的實用知識，再加上請到挪威的分析師演講，整堂課的扎實度極高，然而要修習這堂課，勢必要先修過線性代數、高等微積分等較高階之數學課程，否則要花非常多時間才能大致了解課堂內容，甚至建議先修過基礎板衍生性商品再來，否則難以負荷，若是可以建議檔修一些先備數學知識。以上，非常期待老師下學期開的課程！另外助教非常熱心解題～,"This class is the most rewarding class I have ever taken at National Chengchi University. Although the course content is too difficult for me and lacks a lot of prior knowledge, the teacher allowed me to understand derivative commodities by integrating theory and program practice The application of it can even become practical knowledge for future work. In addition, an analyst from Norway was invited to give a speech. The whole class is very solid. For higher-level mathematics courses such as calculus, otherwise it will take a lot of time to get a general understanding of the content of the class. It is even recommended to learn the derivative products of the basic board first, otherwise it will be difficult to load. If you can, it is recommended to take some pre-requisite mathematics knowledge. With the above, I am very much looking forward to the courses that the teacher will teach next semester!

630cf1c640e337e60fce21af,老師很認真，態度親切，把複雜的學問講解的很清楚易懂。 遺憾的地方是，學校不給這堂課專門的助教，害老師改題目考卷很辛苦;沒有課後練習題，讓學生學到的成效也因此打折扣。希望學校能改進，珍惜學生受教育的機會,"The teacher is serious and kind, and explains the complicated knowledge clearly and easily. It is a pity that the school does not provide a special teaching assistant for this class, which makes it very hard for the teacher to correct the test papers; there are no after-class practice questions, so the effectiveness of students' learning is also compromised.

630cf1c640e337e60fce21b7,應該增加評分項目，避免期中期末佔比過多，所以應減少加簽學生避免增加老師負擔。,"Grading items should be added to avoid too much proportion at the end of the mid-term, so the number of students with signatures should be reduced to avoid increasing the burden on teachers.",1012,746,0,1,0.0006276965141296387
630cf1c640e337e60fce225e,大部分的時間都在給學生報告 導致沒有充足的時間給教授授課 雖然這能夠增加學生的自我思考的能力 但是我覺得教授也需要能夠承擔起教授的身份跟職責 讓學生能夠感受到教授有在認真備課 能不只是大多教給學生跟助教,"Most of the time is spent reporting to students, so there is not enough time to teach professors. Although this can increase students' self-thinking ability, I think professors also need to be able to assume the identity and responsibilities of professors so that students can feel that professors are serious.

630cf1c640e337e60fce2366,老師這學期辛苦了，很幸運能在政大聽到老師的課，每堂課的內容都非常豐富，真的收益良多，老師口條也非常好邏輯清晰，謝謝老師。只是覺得期末遠距考試改兩題很廣泛、感覺更著重自己對於中國背景知識的了解，對平時不太關注中國議題的人不太友善。但還是很喜歡老師這學期的授課內容，把歷史講得很有趣，希望未來還有機會修到老師的課。,"The teacher has worked hard this semester, and I am very lucky to hear the teacher's class at Zhengzhou University. The content of each class is very rich, and I really benefited a lot. The teacher's eloquence is also very clear and logical, thank you teacher. I just feel that changing the two questions in the final distance exam is very extensive, and I feel more focused on my understanding of China's background knowledge, and I am not very friendly to people who usually do not pay much attention to Chinese issues. But I still like the content of the teacher's teaching this semester, and the history is very interesting. I hope that I will have the opportunity to take the teacher's class in the future.",1029,551,0,3,0.9996662139892578
630cf1c640e337e60fce2353,老師的PTT超讚，但是課程內容好難QAQ,"The teacher's PTT is awesome, but the course content is so difficult QAQ",820,751,0,1,0.00873476266860962
630cf1c640e337e60fce2355,建議老師的ppt可以再更清楚一些，皆是文字敘述會比較沒辦法抓住重點， 且老師的課程內容非常豐富，但是我自己本身對中國民族較少的認識，建議老師可以在上課前推薦學生閱讀一些文章或者書籍作為預習，有個概念再進入課程會讓學生比較容易進入狀況。,"It is suggested that the teacher’s ppt can be more clear. It is difficult to grasp the key points if it is all written narration, and the content of the teacher’s course is very rich, but I myself have little knowledge of the Chinese nation. I suggest that the teacher can recommend students before class Reading some articles or books as a preview, and entering the course with a concept will make it easier for students to enter the situation.",820,751,0,1,0.0019662976264953613
630cf1c640e337e60fce2354,老師對中國的領域很有研究，但每堂課的簡報幾乎都將近一百頁，對於學生來說負擔有點重，上了三節課後不知道重點在哪裡，希望老師可以稍微減少課程內容。,"The teacher has a lot of research in the field of China, but the briefing of each class is almost one hundred pages, which is a bit heavy for the students.

630cf1c740e337e60fce2432,這是一門好課，不是因為多甜多涼，也不是對未來職涯非常有益，而是因為他培養學生具備人文素養關懷的能力。藉由文本的導讀，碰撞政治的現實，腦袋不停的運作時，就已經有所收穫了。 政治哲學概論是一堂政治系的必修課，但我舉雙手同意他也應該成為一門通識課。 修這門課不是為了出路，而是為了獲取知識。,"This is a good course, not because it is sweet and cool, nor because it is very beneficial to future careers, but because it cultivates students' ability to be humanistic and caring. With the introduction of the text, when you collide with the political reality and keep your head running, you have already gained something. Introduction to Political Philosophy is a compulsory course in the political department, but I agree with both hands that it should also be a general education course. Taking this course is not for the way out, but for the acquisition of knowledge.",671,574,0,1,0.9989668130874634
630cf1c740e337e60fce2435,閱讀文本的方式非常艱澀，不是每個人都做得來。期末報告的形式比較能夠讓同學認識政治哲學，建議可以調整成整學期比如說小組來討論一些議題，這樣會比老師在前面單獨一個講文本三個小時來得好。更別提 Ferguson 的文本非常難以閱讀，令人抓不到重點。 我會想理解政治哲學，以及其他思想家怎麼看政治，但徹底了解 Ferguson 的思想，特別還是用原文文本導讀的方式，很難引起學生學習的興趣；《正義：一場思辨之旅》等較親和的書，可能更適合拿來討論。,"The way to read the text is very difficult, not everyone can do it. The form of the final report is better for students to understand political philosophy. It is suggested that it can be adjusted into a whole semester, such as a small group to discuss some issues, which will be better than the teacher speaking alone for three hours in front of the text. Not to mention that Ferguson's text is extremely difficult to read and misses the point. I would like to understand political philosophy and how other thinkers look at politics, but a thorough understanding of Ferguson's thoughts, especially with the introduction of the original text, is difficult to arouse students' interest in learning; Books may be more suitable for discussion.",671,574,0,1,0.0005096197128295898

630cf1c640e337e60fce225f,還是老師自己教會比較好，讓同學報告幾乎每個章節有點太過了，很多東西還是要我們自己回家看ppt，聽同學的報告根本留不住什麼在腦袋裡,It is better for the teacher to teach by himself.

630cf1c740e337e60fce2400,建議老師分組的時候還是可以讓學生有辦法自己分組 不然容易造成組別內的人能力參差不齊 討論起來很沒效率 對於課程的感受度也會變差,"It is suggested that when the teacher divides into groups, students should still have a way to group themselves, otherwise it will easily lead to uneven abilities of the people in the group, and it will be very inefficient to discuss, and the perception of the course will also deteriorate",272,557,0,1,0.00020104646682739258

This class itself is the basis of marketing management. You can judge whether you are interested in this field.

The teacher's way of teaching has enhanced my interest in the tax law. I also like the tax review written by the teacher on current events! I went to watch Born's ""Interesting Speech"" live. When I saw the teacher's tax assessment, I was surprised and went to Bone's club to discuss with fans. As a result, many fans didn't understand why Bone should lower the ticket price. Discussing (O) quarreling (X) with them in the club for a long time, in short, I really like the teacher's tax assessment, let us look at the current affairs related to taxation from the perspective of scholars!

630cf1c740e337e60fce2570,老師上課會講很多新聞和案例，有點不法律的感覺，反而學到很多商業知識，真的是很讚的一堂課,"The teacher will talk about a lot of news and cases in class, which feels a bit illegal, but he learned a lot of business knowledge. It is really a great class",57,586,0,1,0.9995833039283752
630cf1c740e337e60fce2574,希望作業可以由一人交就好，有時候會有組員拖到很晚才做，其他人要等他給作業才能交很麻煩。我覺得老師講課很棒，會選遠距比較好的原因不是不想見到您，只是教室太悶容易想睡，老師不要難過！,"I hope that the homework can be handed in by one person. Sometimes some team members delay doing it until very late, and it is very troublesome for others to wait for him to hand in the homework. I think the teacher's lectures are very good. The reason why I choose the distance is not because I don't want to see you, but the classroom is too boring and easy to fall asleep. Don't be sad, teacher!",57,586,0,1,0.003023982048034668

630cf1c740e337e60fce248e,老師熱心、認真，樂於為學生解惑。但課程內容難度蠻高，希望可以循序漸進地講解。,"The teacher is enthusiastic, serious, and willing to solve students' doubts. However, the content of the course is quite difficult, and I hope that it can be explained step by step.",1039,567,0,2,0.130327045917511
630cf1c740e337e60fce2491,老師上課風格非常有趣，舉例也很實在。師生互動良好，鼓勵學生發言和提問。提供了非常多語言學及詞彙上的知識，但仍希望可以對詞彙教學這塊多著墨。,"The teacher's teaching style is very interesting, and the examples are very practical.

630cf1c740e337e60fce2573,老師的課很有趣，學期初不習慣老師的語速，但慢慢就能習慣。但分組作業令我有點困擾，因為不能自選組員，結果分到雷組員了。,"The teacher's class is very interesting.

630cf1c740e337e60fce24b5,上老師的課真的能循序漸進地學習越文，美中不足的是遠距教學後希望老師地語速能再慢一點點，雖然有錄音可以回聽但有時還是稍微會跟不上速度。,"In the teacher's class, I can really learn Vietnamese step by step.

Although it will help a lot in the future work and valuation practice, but in the final exam, I will not know how to prepare, especially because there are many difficult problems in practice, and there will be a lot of learning When I feel confused, I hope that the teacher can make more adjustments to the speech after considering the students.",1036,562,0,3,0.0026911497116088867

630cf1c740e337e60fce25ad,很喜歡這堂課！老師講解的很清楚，讓我發現其實語音學滿有趣的。雖然有些地方比較難，可是老師都會很耐心的再講一遍，我覺得老師真是人美心善～～只有一些小建議是感覺期末可以在報告跟考試中擇一就好（或是報告、口試、筆試三選二？）期末三個都要loading有點重。另外建議老師可以再斟酌一下配分，因為我覺得報告要花的心力蠻多的，要口頭發表還要交書面，卻只佔總成績的10%，感覺有點不符比例。總之謝謝老師～希望以後可以再上到老師的課！,"Loved this class! The teacher explained very clearly, which made me find that phonetics is actually very interesting. Although some places are more difficult, the teacher will repeat it patiently. I think the teacher is really kind-hearted~~ There are only some small suggestions. I feel that I can choose between the report and the exam at the end of the term (or report, oral test, Choose two out of three in the written test?) At the end of the term, all three must be loaded, which is a bit heavy. In addition, I suggest that the teacher can reconsider the allocation of marks, because I think the report takes a lot of effort, and the oral presentation must be submitted in writing, but it only accounts for 10% of the total score, which feels a bit out of proportion.

630cf1c740e337e60fce2572,課程結合時事新聞讓不是法律專業的學生也能充分理解並應用，但ppt容易有字數過多的問題，無法迅速從簡報中看到重點。另外小組成員是老師分派，真的很吃組員，大部分人不把這堂課作業當一回事，又不願意溝通時常神隱，會讓在意成績的同學需要負擔高於平均的作業量，希望這部分老師可以開放自選組員或減少團體報告次數。,"The course combines current affairs and news so that students who are not majors in law can fully understand and apply it, but the ppt is prone to problems with too many words, and it is impossible to quickly see the key points from the presentation. In addition, the group members are assigned by the teacher, and they really like the group members. Most of them don’t take this homework seriously, and they are unwilling to communicate with each other. This will make the students who care about grades need to bear a higher than average amount of homework.

630cf1c740e337e60fce23e1,老師感覺不太在意學生的學習狀況，遠距影片也會放去年的，講話非常緩慢，要很有耐心。,"The teacher feels that he doesn't care much about the students' learning status, and the long-distance videos will also be shown last year. The speech is very slow, so be patient.",99,575,0,1,0.00027698278427124023
630cf1c740e337e60fce245f,這堂課很重，我認為這堂課最辛苦的不是要做出報告，而是要在每個禮拜都要做報告，所以之後比較有空然後讀課本(因為很多頁)時，其實會發現當時報告有些內容是當時可以做更好、或是沒注意到的，我覺得這點特別可惜，建議調整報告份量，或修課者不要修太多學分，而且可能是因老師要照顧每一組太辛苦了，例如我們照之前老師給的建議做之後，老師卻在之後給了不同意見並要求我們調整，這點有點讓人無所適從，不過沒有深究老師意見的箇中原因也是我們的問題。另外這堂課會讓有課外書要讀(例如國考)的同學滿辛苦。,"This class is very heavy. I think the hardest part of this class is not to make a report, but to make a report every week, so when you have time to read the textbook (because there are many pages), you will actually find At that time, some contents of the report could have been improved or were not noticed at the time. I think this is a pity. It is recommended to adjust the weight of the report, or the students should not take too many credits, and it may be because the teacher has to take care of each group. It was too hard. For example, after we followed the advice given by the teacher before, the teacher gave different opinions and asked us to adjust. This is a bit confusing, but the root cause of the teacher's opinion is also our problem. In addition, this class will make it hard for students who have extracurricular books to read (such as the national exam).",1034,564,0,1,0.0005715489387512207

630cf1c740e337e60fce24a1,期末跑步的量本來讓我超級擔心，因為我在高中讀女校時從沒一次跑過這麼多里程數，但意外遠距反而逃過一劫，希望老師考量到男女學生生理結構差異，在期末評量的部分能在分數上做出調整，達到實質平等,"The amount of running at the end of the term made me super worried, because I never ran so many miles when I was in a girls' school in high school, but I escaped by accidental distance. I hope that the teacher will consider the differences in the physiological structure of male and female students. The parts of the assessment can be adjusted in points to achieve substantive equality",366,576,0,1,0.960473895072937

630cf1c740e337e60fce257f,遠距後有時會有連線問題，老師說話會有一點斷,"Sometimes there will be connection problems after a long distance, and the teacher's speech will be a little disconnected",57,586,0,1,0.0005595088005065918
630cf1c740e337e60fce25a5,老師每週都很用心的準備課程與PPT，以及各類的文獻介紹，導讀、提問，讓我學了很多,"The teacher prepares courses and PPT carefully every week, as well as various literature introductions, reading guides, and asking questions, so I learned a lot",1041,596,0,1,0.9436293244361877

630cf1c740e337e60fce23e7,課程內容扎實，但是老師的講解非常清楚。老師也非常重視學生，上課與作業的方式都會詢問學生們的意見。希望可以提供一些學生可以自主練習的題目。,"The course content is solid, but the teacher's explanation is very clear. Teachers also attach great importance to students, and they will ask students for their opinions in the way of class and homework.

630cf1c740e337e60fce2517,老師很幽默，點名的時候會關心大家，每周不同的文學主題經過講解後就能更了解故事內容，也許學期分數可以新增一些小作業與原先有的考試共同計分。,"The teacher is very humorous, and cares about everyone during the roll call. After explaining different literary themes every week, you can understand the content of the story better. Maybe some small assignments can be added to the semester grades to be scored together with the original exams.",677,589,0,1,0.9900172352790833
630cf1c740e337e60fce24b6,老師上課很輕鬆，每次口語練習都有激發到我的腦力，作業量也很剛好，跟著老師走，可以學到很多東西,"The teacher is very relaxed in class. Every oral practice stimulates my brain power, and the amount of homework is just right. I can learn a lot by following the teacher.",1032,560,0,3,0.9998606443405151
630cf1c740e337e60fce24e5,老師簡報架構可以再更加明確順暢一點，有時候太跳，簡報架構跟問題不少很難讓大家進入狀況，而且老師習慣不提前給學生簡報，這樣上課沒有辦法同時紀錄非常不方便；報告書製作希望老師可以一開始給予更明確的指示跟安排，以免大家常常陷入考不清楚狀況的情形；老師這學期找了很多學長姐或是業界人士來演講，但演講過多很難讓人抓到本學期學習重點，然後老師很多上課也沒教到，都是交由演講解決，演講完又馬上說要期末考試要考，這樣大家根本沒吸收好、老師講解也不夠的情況下學習十分困難,"The structure of the teacher’s presentation can be more clear and smooth. Sometimes it is too jumpy. There are many problems in the presentation structure and it is difficult for everyone to get into the situation. Moreover, the teacher is used to not giving the briefing to the students in advance, so it is very inconvenient to have no way to record at the same time during class; report making I hope that the teacher can give clearer instructions and arrangements at the beginning, so as to avoid the situation that everyone often falls into the situation where the test is not clear; the teacher has invited many senior sisters or people from the industry to give speeches this semester, but too many speeches make it difficult for people to catch this semester The key points of learning, and then the teacher did not teach them in many classes, and they left it to the lectures to solve. After the lectures, they immediately said that they would have to take the final exam. In this way, everyone did not absorb well, and the teacher did not explain enough. It is very difficult to study.",1036,562,0,3,0.0005106925964355469
630cf1c740e337e60fce24cb,自編講義邏輯幫助學習，老師上課時常補充財稅相關時事~,"The logic of self-made lecture notes helps learning, and the teacher often supplements current affairs related to finance and taxation in class~",648,559,0,1,0.835708737373352
630cf1c740e337e60fce24e3,希望老師之後能先將當週上課的簡報上傳到moodle平台，讓學生能邊上課邊在簡報上做筆記,"I hope the teacher can upload the class briefing of the week to the moodle platform first, so that students can take notes on the briefing while attending class",1036,562,0,3,0.006078481674194336

630cf1c740e337e60fce24c7,老師的教材不只有教科書上的內容，還有很多補充的資料，包括老師本人自己撰寫的稅評，都讓我在財政學這堂課學到很多。財政跟生活息息相關，老師利用這樣的教學方式個人覺得非常適合!,"The teacher's teaching materials are not only the content of the textbook, but also a lot of supplementary materials, including the tax assessment written by the teacher himself, which let me learn a lot in this class of finance. Finance is closely related to life, and the teacher personally thinks it is very suitable to use this teaching method!",648,559,0,1,0.8793842196464539

630cf1c740e337e60fce24df,不動產估價是一門很專業的課程，感覺得出實際的操作細節很需要經驗的累積，因此老師在課堂上分析的實務案例與邀請業界人士分享，都很有助於我建構相關知識。在教學方面，老師的表達也總是精準到位，能從中提煉出重點，課後請教老師問題也總能收穫良多！更有助於我對知識的理解。,"Real estate valuation is a very professional course, and I feel that the actual operation details require the accumulation of experience. Therefore, the practical cases analyzed by the teacher in class and the invitation of industry professionals to share are very helpful for me to build relevant knowledge. In terms of teaching, the teacher's expression is always accurate and in place, and he can extract key points from it, and he can always gain a lot from asking the teacher questions after class! It is more helpful to my understanding of knowledge.",1036,562,0,3,0.9990097284317017

630cf1c740e337e60fce251b,子威好棒！實體上課的時候如果沒有常常聽跑戰術的講解的同學可能會一時無法消化，但老師也都很樂意另外回答問題或是會請比較有經驗的同學幫忙帶，即使期中後多半換成線上也可以學到很多老師用心準備的籃球相關知識（雖然老師有時候會被網路衝康當機xd) 覺得在這學期學習到很多系隊沒辦法練到的場上知識！謝謝老師～,"Ziwei is great! Students who do not often listen to the explanation of running tactics may not be able to digest it for a while during the physical class, but the teacher is also willing to answer questions or ask more experienced students to help.

630cf1c740e337e60fce258b,這堂課程有許多課前作業，上課也很常需要發言表達自己的見解，所以常常會覺得壓力很大，但慢慢累積起來的知識量也很豐富，在學習刑法的邏輯思維上也越來越清晰，適合平時願意按部就班、扎實學習路線的學生！,"There are a lot of pre-class assignments in this course, and I often need to speak to express my own opinions in class, so I often feel a lot of pressure, but the accumulated knowledge is also very rich, and the logical thinking of learning criminal law is also getting better and better.

630cf1c740e337e60fce25c1,希望老師的授課內容可以更加深入，避免出現重複的案例，並明確說明每週作業和報告內容，確實參照學校行事曆安排課程。兩位老師共同授課，宜事先完成妥善的工作分配，才不會使學生無所適從。,"It is hoped that the content of the teacher's lectures can be more in-depth to avoid repeated cases, and clearly explain the content of weekly homework and reports, and arrange courses according to the school calendar.

630cf1c740e337e60fce25b0,老師的上課內容非常棒，但希望可以取消期末報告的部分，以每週作業取代之。 雖然我是本來就有程式基礎的學生，但我能理解那些第一次接觸程式就要寫完整期末報告的那種痛苦。 像是lambda filter class 這種技巧，沒有透過日常的練習，是無法在期末報告很直覺使用的～ 不過授課的內容還是非常棒的，透過例子讓學生們能夠快速易懂。謝謝老師！,"The teacher's class content is very good, but I hope that the part of the final report can be eliminated and replaced by weekly assignments. Although I am a student who already has a programming foundation, I can understand the pain of those who have to write a complete final report for the first time when they come into contact with programming. Skills such as lambda filter class cannot be used intuitively in the final report without daily practice~ However, the content of the lecture is still very good, and students can understand it quickly and easily through examples.

630cf1c740e337e60fce259b,老師採用翻轉教育的方式，獲益良多，一方面也發現自己看影片學習是漏掉的部分，一方面也進行複習及實例演練，考試時更能輕鬆掌握方向，謝謝老師,"The teacher adopted the method of flipping education and benefited a lot.

It is easier to grasp the direction during the exam. Thank you teacher",873,577,0,1,0.878455400466919
630cf1c740e337e60fce259c,我覺得課前預習非常好，但有時候就會發生課堂上老師再講一次的窘境，就會覺得很浪費時間，也會覺得討論的時候時間沒有被利用的非常完善  有時候也覺得預習刑法的時間太多，因為看影片跟做筆記要花的時間太多，很容易造成壓力，希望老師在筆記上可以不要這麼強制要求，有時候覺得 寫在書上比較好記時，又會為了完成作業要再抄一份，反而想為做而做,"I think the pre-class preview is very good, but sometimes the teacher will talk again in class, and I feel that it is a waste of time, and I also feel that the time is not being used very well during the discussion. Too much time, because it takes too much time to watch videos and take notes, which can easily cause stress. I hope the teacher can not be so mandatory in the notes. Sometimes when I think it is better to write in a book, I will do it in order to complete the homework.

630cf1c740e337e60fce258e,老師很認真在教學方面，我覺得自主學習又比上學期的課後反思好，但我覺得老師可能有時候不要情緒轉變太快，會讓學生壓力很大，然後希望老師不要限定一定要在禮拜天前交學習紀錄，我們也有其他的課程需要顧及，並非只有這一科。,"The teacher is very serious about teaching. I think independent learning is better than after-school reflection last semester, but I think the teacher may not change his mood too quickly sometimes, which will put a lot of pressure on the students, and I hope the teacher will not limit it to Sunday I handed in my study records a few days ago. We also have other subjects to take care of, not just this subject.",873,577,0,1,0.9835752248764038
630cf1c740e337e60fce262c,希望可以教快一點但是作業不要那麼多,I hope I can teach faster but not so much homework,96,580,0,1,0.0127716064453125
630cf1c740e337e60fce2598,負荷很重、同時可以學到很多東西的一堂課～ 課程要求部分：(1)每周課前需依進度觀看老師的教學影片預習（平均一周要看3小時的上課影片）並作筆記上傳到moodle(2)老師很注重學生的課堂參與，因此每堂課都會分組討論案例並由老師隨機抽點同學回答(3)每堂課必全班點名，且點名時間不固定，不可能有代點狀況。 老師教得很好很清楚，專心跟進度能把刑總底子打好，但這堂絕對不涼，不建議只想混學分的學生選。最後在此感謝老師一年來的教導。,"A class with a heavy load and a lot of things to learn at the same time~ Course requirements: (1) You need to watch the teacher's teaching video preview according to the progress before class every week (an average of 3 hours of class videos per week) and take notes and upload to moodle (2) The teacher pays great attention to the students' classroom participation, so each class will discuss the case in groups and the teacher will randomly select some students to answer (3) Every class must be called by the whole class, and the time for roll call is not fixed, so there is no possibility of substituting points situation. The teacher taught very well and clearly. Concentration and progress can lay a solid foundation for the Criminal Division, but this class is definitely not cool. It is not recommended for students who just want to mix credits. Finally, I would like to thank the teacher for his teaching over the past year.",873,577,0,1,0.18468177318572998
630cf1c740e337e60fce25cf,以輕鬆討論方式，從不同論點中探討社會責任議題，相當有趣。,It is quite interesting to explore social responsibility issues from different perspectives in a relaxed manner.,32,593,0,1,0.999853253364563
630cf1c840e337e60fce26bf,英傑老師超棒！上課很有溫度，批改作業超級用心，會給學生精恰的評語～～,"Teacher Yingjie is awesome! The class is very warm, correcting homework is super attentive, and will give students accurate comments~~",773,616,0,1,0.9998599290847778
630cf1c740e337e60fce2599,影片可以重複看，很棒！ 討論也真的有助記憶！ 如果可以用鼓勵，而非批評就更好了。 老師可以不要太有先入為主的觀念，同學其實有讀，只是回答不完整，就認定同學沒讀。,"The video can be watched repeatedly, which is great! Discussion really helps with memory too! It would be better if you could use encouragement instead of criticism. The teacher can not be too preconceived. The students actually read it, but they just answered incompletely, so it is assumed that the students did not read it.",873,577,0,1,0.9919889569282532

630cf1c840e337e60fce26bc,詞選課真的好精彩！老師的解說與延伸理解真的有讓我覺得原來古人的情感是可以如此複雜，而這種複雜也可以透過簡練的文字表達出來，,"The selection of words is really exciting! The teacher's explanation and extended understanding really made me feel that the emotions of the ancients can be so complicated, and this complexity can also be expressed through concise words.",773,616,0,1,0.9997774958610535
630cf1c740e337e60fce258d,老師教學很認真，還會運用許多案例讓學生能清楚了解教學內容。雖然每週都會有課前預習的影片要看，會花不少時間，但是每次看完影片都獲益良多，很值得。,"The teacher is very serious in teaching, and will use many cases to let students understand the teaching content clearly. Although there are pre-class preview videos to watch every week, it will take a lot of time, but every time I watch the videos, I will benefit a lot and it is worth it.",873,577,0,1,0.9998210072517395
630cf1c740e337e60fce258c,老師上學期中，開始讓我們使用課前就看影片把上課內容全部搞懂，上課時是問問題要我們討論。 我明白老師的苦心，也總是認真看影片作筆記。惟，到了這學期越來越注重在筆記精美度，聽課的部分越來越不認真，有次跟同學討論完得出錯的答案，老師聽完我的答案後，展現出的一連串情緒讓我被嚇傻了。 我知道這部分是我自己沒有做好，因為既然選了老師的課，就要遵守老師訂下要做的事，但也是真的遇到才知道，朋友之前說的老師有些時候很兇是怎樣... 希望老師可以在這種時候，和顏悅色的給予警告。謝謝老師的教,"During the last semester, the teacher asked us to watch videos before using the class to understand all the content of the class. During class, he asked questions for us to discuss. I understand the painstaking efforts of the teacher, and I always watch the video carefully and take notes. However, in this semester, I pay more and more attention to the exquisiteness of notes, and the part of listening to the lectures is becoming less and less serious. Once I discussed the wrong answer with my classmates. After listening to my answer, the teacher showed a series of emotions. Scared out of my wits. I know that I didn’t do this part well, because since I chose the teacher’s class, I have to follow the teacher’s order to do things, but I only know it when I meet it. My friend said that the teacher is sometimes fierce. ... I hope the teacher can give a warning in a friendly manner at this time. Thank you teacher for teaching",873,577,0,1,0.4206134080886841
630cf1c840e337e60fce2766,遠距時今年錄的課程似乎都太小聲，電腦音量已調至最大仍聽不太清楚,"The courses recorded this year seem to be too quiet when they are far away, and the volume of the computer has been turned up to the maximum, but I still can’t hear clearly",648,618,0,1,0.014035940170288086

630cf1c740e337e60fce25d6,老師給予的文本十分有趣，教學態度也十分認真負責，總體而言是極好的。惟老師上課教授內容較偏高中歷史的感覺，比較像是知識小補充；主題式教學也易使學生感覺不脈絡。不過我尚無如何改善的主意，只是提出一己之見供教師參考。,"The text given by the teacher is very interesting, and the teaching attitude is very serious and responsible. Overall, it is excellent. However, the content taught by the teacher in class seems to be more about high school history, and it is more like a small supplement to knowledge; thematic teaching can also easily make students feel out of context. However, I have no idea how to improve it. I just put forward my own opinion for the teacher's reference.",1049,601,0,1,0.917433500289917

630cf1c740e337e60fce25b5,每周課前分享商事法相關的新聞非常有趣，學期後段可能因為時間較緊湊，老師就比較少分享新聞了，希望老師每周都能花一點時間分享新聞，個人認為對於引起學生學習動機相當有幫助，謝謝老師。,"It is very interesting to share news related to commercial law before class every week. In the latter part of the semester, teachers may share less news because of the tight schedule. I hope teachers can spend a little time sharing news every week. I personally think that it is quite effective in arousing students' learning motivation. Help, thank you teacher.",57,586,0,1,0.9991204142570496
630cf1c740e337e60fce2595,優點就是 課前預習去年的影片真的很棒 因為可以不斷重複學習 對於老師上課要講的東西也可以先了解以免聽不懂，而且影片聽不懂可以不斷重播 對於刑法如此困難的科目真的很需要 還有線上分組討論也很棒可以認識系上的新同學 缺點是老師上課點人回答一旦答錯老師的臉色會不好看 同學要有承受壓力的能力 還有上課要繃緊神經,"The advantage is that it is really great to preview last year's videos before class because you can learn repeatedly. You can also understand what the teacher is going to say in class before you don't understand, and if you don't understand the videos, you can keep replaying them. Need to have online group discussion is also very good to meet new students in the department. The disadvantage is that the teacher will ask someone to answer in class. Once the teacher answers wrongly, the teacher’s face will not look good. Students must be able to withstand pressure and have to tense up in class",873,577,0,1,0.39820271730422974

630cf1c740e337e60fce25e9,1.談話有趣，但跟重點黏在一起，讓人措手不及。 2.比起講課速度，確保學生能夠吸收或許更能提升效率。 3.交代作業時希望可以條理化，因為目前讓人專注聽了卻還是不知所云。 4.課程內容知識量過大，未能配合大一程度深入淺出。,"1. The conversation is interesting, but it sticks to the key points, which makes people caught off guard. 2. Compared with the speed of lectures, ensuring that students can absorb may be more efficient. 3. When explaining homework, I hope it can be organized, because at present, people are listening attentively but still don't know what to say. 4. The amount of knowledge in the course content is too large to match the freshman level.",900,754,0,1,0.04622405767440796
630cf1c740e337e60fce2591,希望老師更加尊重學生的提問及發表的言論，多多給予鼓勵，也不要急著否定學生的想法。,"I hope that teachers will respect students' questions and comments more, give more encouragement, and don't rush to deny students' ideas.",873,577,0,1,0.9983261227607727

630cf1c840e337e60fce26e7,老師講解得非常扎實！問問題也都回覆得很清楚！謝謝老師。 不過可能是因為是學碩合開的關係？總覺得自己筆記完還是有點難跟上。 詢問過這門課的同學，他說有些基礎知識確實是統計系本系的進階課程才會學到的， 所以外系相較之下理解上可能會比較吃力。 （擔心期末報告......到時候可能得再繼續請教老師了！非常感謝！）,"The teacher explained very solidly! Questions are answered very clearly! Thank you, teacher. But it may be because of the relationship between studying and mastering? I always feel that it is still a bit difficult to keep up after I finish taking notes. I asked the students who took this course, and he said that some basic knowledge can only be learned in the advanced courses of the Department of Statistics, so it may be more difficult to understand in comparison with other departments.

630cf1c740e337e60fce2616,老師很用心編教材，講課詳細，也時常幫我們複習，老師真的很棒！ 如果老師也可以和土地法一樣錄製影片我一定會很開心，這樣老師也比較不會有時間壓力，可以上多一些內容？,"The teacher compiled the teaching materials very carefully, gave detailed lectures, and often helped us review. The teacher is really great! I will be very happy if the teacher can also record videos like the Land Law, so that the teacher will not have time pressure and can upload more content?",1050,756,0,1,0.9997332692146301

630cf1c840e337e60fce26e2,老師教學認真，也很樂意幫助解決學生的問題。謝謝老師！,"Teachers are serious about teaching and are willing to help solve students' problems. Thank you, teacher!",1051,632,0,3,0.9998588562011719
630cf1c740e337e60fce264e,謝謝老師的教導!雖然有時候內容真的很艱澀也需要話很多心力，但老師還是不厭其煩地為我們解惑，老師辛苦了!,"Thank you teacher for your teaching!

630cf1c740e337e60fce25e8,謝謝老師用心備課、準備優質的課程給學生，這使有認真修習這門課的學生們受益良多。,"Thank you teacher for carefully preparing lessons and preparing high-quality courses for students, which has benefited students who have taken this course seriously.",900,754,0,1,0.9997571110725403
630cf1c740e337e60fce264a,老師上課真的很認真，也會努力回答學生的問題，但有時候上課速度太快，還沒思考完就進入下一階段了，造成上課有時候會聽不太懂。,"The teacher is really serious in class, and will try to answer students' questions, but sometimes the class is too fast, and the next stage is entered before the end of thinking, which sometimes makes the class difficult to understand.",781,581,0,1,0.002784252166748047
630cf1c740e337e60fce2615,希望老師對於整學期課程開始前未提到的上課規則不需要去大聲駁斥，對於有明令禁止的行為已經沒去做了，沒提過的不順眼行為一開始應該用勸導的就好吧。而且老師不是大學畢業後連訴願都沒聽過嗎，怎麼會覺得我們這些從差不多的教育體制下出來的學弟妹好像什麼都應該懂==,"I hope that the teacher does not need to refute the class rules that were not mentioned before the start of the whole semester, and has not done any behaviors that are expressly prohibited. And the teacher didn’t even hear the petition after graduating from university, why do you think that our juniors who come from a similar education system should know everything ==",1050,756,0,1,0.0077797770500183105

630cf1c740e337e60fce264d,非常感謝老師的教導，老師上課時都會非常詳細的講解觀念，也會帶著我們練習釋例，讓中會變的更具體，我非常喜歡上老師的中會課程。,"I am very grateful for the teaching of the teacher.

I really like the teacher's middle school courses.",781,581,0,1,0.9997400641441345
630cf1c840e337e60fce26cf,老師人很好，但教學方式讓人不太好吸收，如果在解講處理方法時多舉一些例子，多帶一些例題應該會更好,"The teacher is very good, but the teaching method is not easy to absorb. It would be better if more examples and sample questions are given when explaining the processing methods",781,625,0,1,0.009362757205963135
630cf1c840e337e60fce2684,Professor always answers the questions patiently and uses understandable English to explain.

630cf1c840e337e60fce278d,我覺得老師上課很認真，講課內容也準備得完整，在一開始比較基礎的結構介紹會花蠻多時間為我們打好基礎，免疫的地方也補充了與生活時事相關的COVID-19疫苗，蠻好玩的。,"I think the teacher is very serious in the class, and the content of the lectures is also well prepared. At the beginning, the introduction of the basic structure will take a lot of time to lay a good foundation for us. The place of immunization also supplemented the COVID-19 vaccine related to current life events, quite Fun.",988,755,0,1,0.9973383545875549
630cf1c840e337e60fce274d,上老師的課如沐春風，感覺到文學的洗禮，卻又不會太艱澀生硬，很喜歡老師偶爾以家中生活舉的例子！,"Taking the teacher's class is like a spring breeze, and I feel the baptism of literature, but it is not too difficult and blunt. I like the example that the teacher occasionally gives from life at home!",1053,616,0,3,0.9990915060043335
630cf1c740e337e60fce25c3,期末報告設在學期結束後一天就算了 甚至還在前一週突然多一個書面報告要我們暑假第一週交 理由是要交畢業生成績 所以不能延後  既然教授知道自己要交成績就早點公告作業啊 我們真的沒有義務要配合這些莫名其妙的東西 拜託改進 當大家都不用讀別科？,"The end-of-semester report is set one day after the end of the semester, even the week before. Suddenly there is another written report that we have to hand in in the first week of summer vacation. The reason is that we have to hand in the grades of the graduates, so we can’t postpone it. Since the professor knows that he has to hand in the grades, he should announce the homework earlier. We really have no obligation to cooperate with these inexplicable things, please improve when everyone doesn't need to study other subjects?",823,596,0,2,0.004713296890258789
630cf1c740e337e60fce25fa,非常感謝老師，獲益良多。 （而且老師的講義實在太厲害了！ 雖然我應該沒有要考中文研究所） 好懷念老師的實體課，今年能再遇到老師真是太好了 : ) 敬祝　平安健康順心,"Thank you very much, teacher, I have benefited a lot.

630cf1c740e337e60fce25ee,不是每個同學都是天資聰穎、天賦過人的，希望可以改善教學內容。 若是沒有多少基礎的同學來聽這門課，會不知道自己存在的意義。 格律對仗的部分希望可以講解得更簡單易懂一些，因為從前這部分高中課程並沒有提及太多。  不過在考研究所，跟教師甄試的部分蠻用心在講的，可以看出是真心為同學好。就是講的內容沒太多的脈絡讓學生去抓住重點、融會貫通。,"Not every student is talented and gifted, and I hope that the teaching content can be improved. If students who do not have much basic knowledge come to this class, they will not know the meaning of their existence. I hope that the part of the metrical confrontation can be explained more simply and understandably, because this part of the high school curriculum did not mention much in the past. However, in the examination institute, I talked with the teacher about the part of the examination with my heart, and it can be seen that I really do my best for my classmates. That is, the content of the lecture does not have too much context to allow students to grasp the key points and integrate them.",900,754,0,1,0.9728233218193054

630cf1c840e337e60fce2751,以前對李商隱的了解，僅止於選讀詩作，不過在修習這堂課之後，更進一步認識了詩人本身以及其詩歌以悲為慣的情懷。 老師的解說細膩抒情，透過細讀使學生一同在李商隱詩中找尋共鳴及感動。,"In the past, my understanding of Li Shangyin was limited to reading selected poems, but after taking this class, I got a better understanding of the poet himself and his poetic feelings of sadness. The teacher's explanation is delicate and lyrical. Through careful reading, the students can find resonance and touch in Li Shangyin's poems.",1053,616,0,3,0.9991456270217896

630cf1c840e337e60fce26ce,老師真的好可愛！而且還超認真備課，都會跟我們補充中文做法。 但希望不論是遠距課還是實體課老師也可以錄影存檔上傳課程庫…有時上課沒辦法完全get到，但上學期初有影片存檔時就可以重複去觀看影片。,"The teacher is really cute! Moreover, he prepares lessons very carefully, and will supplement Chinese practice with us. But I hope teachers, whether it is a distance class or a physical class, can also record and upload the video to the course library... Sometimes it is impossible to get it completely in class, but when there is a video archive at the beginning of last semester, you can watch the video repeatedly.",781,625,0,1,0.016584157943725586
630cf1c840e337e60fce269e,老師對於學生非常關心，遇到任何學科問題也都可以跟老師討論！是值得推薦的好老師！,"The teacher is very concerned about the students, and you can discuss any subject problems with the teacher! It is a good teacher worth recommending!",231,612,0,1,0.9998570680618286
630cf1c740e337e60fce25eb,希望老師可以給我們一份可以循序漸進了解詩選的講義或教材，並由淺到深帶我們了解這個領域，我們還是大一生，多數同學對於文學方面的知識可能稍顯不足，希望老師可以先從較簡單的內容開始，也希望連結到研究所的次數不要那麼高，我知道老師真的很用心教導我們，只是研究所對這個課程還有小大一們可能還有點太早了。,"I hope that the teacher can give us a handout or textbook that can help us understand the anthology step by step, and guide us to understand this field from shallow to deep. We are still freshmen, and most of the students may not have enough knowledge about literature. I hope the teacher can start with I started with simpler content, and I hope that the number of links to the graduate school will not be so high.

630cf1c840e337e60fce26b4,老師人很好，上課的時候也會很耐心地講解内容，整個就很溫暖的氛圍~ 由於這堂課會有很多的英文交流/上臺發表，老師在我們發表之後都會針對我們所用的字/詞去建議我們可以怎麽更好發揮，我覺得這個很棒！謝謝老師的用心~ 老師在課堂上也會很多的和我們互動，也有很多的小組討論，就有效的讓我們可以去練習口説，真的有減少了我害怕講英文的程度。但建議老師在後來給我們閲讀讀物的時間可以長一些，因爲太多了而且有點深奧會讀不完~ 謝謝老師這學期的教導！,"The teacher is very nice, and he will patiently explain the content in class, and the whole atmosphere is very warm~ Since there will be a lot of English communication/presentation in this class, the teacher will target the words/phrases we use after we publish To suggest how we can play better, I think this is great! Thank you teacher for your hard work~ The teacher also interacts with us a lot in class, and there are also a lot of group discussions, which effectively allows us to practice speaking, which really reduces my fear of speaking English.

630cf1c840e337e60fce278b,覺得考試範圍太多太廣，真的有點太難。PPT可以在上課時間就給學生，這樣比較好做筆記，不然等上完課再馬上給投影片其實沒有什麼幫助。,"I feel that the scope of the exam is too much and too broad, which is really a bit too difficult. PPT can be given to students during class time, so it is better to take notes, otherwise it is not helpful to give slides immediately after class.",988,755,0,1,0.00022047758102416992

630cf1c740e337e60fce25c7,遠距上課時看電影仍需要開鏡頭，對於家裡沒有基地台需要依靠手機連線的同學不太友善，上一堂課下來手機耗電量超快。 老師對於同學的課程參與要求比其他老師高，可能是希望大家都能認真上課。 整體來說這堂課還是很輕鬆的課～電影也都很好看～,"Watching movies in remote classes still needs to turn on the camera. It is not friendly to students who do not have a base station at home and need to rely on mobile phone connections. After a class, the battery consumption of mobile phones is super fast. The teacher has higher requirements for the class participation of the students than other teachers, probably because he hopes that everyone can take the class seriously. On the whole, this class is still very easy~ The movies are also very good~",1046,582,0,3,0.9947187900543213

630cf1c740e337e60fce25da,這堂課的授課內容很廣，對社會史（婦女、信仰、旅遊等等）的探討是我最喜歡的地方。 也很喜歡聽老師講一些歷史人物的好笑事蹟,"The class was very broad, and the discussion of social history (women, faith, travel, etc.) was my favorite.

630cf1c840e337e60fce26d8,老師很認真整理Kieso和鄭丁旺中會的講義內容，但希望可以用系統化的方式教學與表達，不要只是沿著講義編排念課文，避免學生見樹不見林。遠距授課期間，希望老師學會用goodnote或notability等筆記軟體教學,"The teacher carefully sorted out the content of the handouts of Kieso and Zheng Dingwang Middle School, but hoped that they could teach and express in a systematic way, instead of just arranging and reading the text along the handouts, so as to prevent students from seeing the forest for the trees. During distance teaching, teachers are expected to learn to use note-taking software such as goodnote or notability to teach",781,625,0,1,0.00625687837600708
630cf1c740e337e60fce2631,非常扎實的一堂課，雖然是比較難的內容但兩位老師的引導思考能夠幫助理解，兩位背景不同的老師也可以補足很多面向的觀點，對金融治理和金融相關議題更有興趣。秉逵和正運CP間的互動和上課很有趣，成效加倍！,"It was a very solid class. Although the content was relatively difficult, the guiding thinking of the two teachers could help to understand, and the two teachers with different backgrounds could also make up a lot of perspectives, and they were more interested in financial governance and financial related issues.

630cf1c740e337e60fce264f,老師教得很好，中會唯一推明進！但希望老師可以調節每節課的進度，因為前面有時候講得比較慢，會導致後面為了趕課而講課速度過快。,"The teacher taught very well, and the club is the only way to promote Mingjin! But I hope that the teacher can adjust the progress of each class, because sometimes the lectures are slower in the front, which will lead to the lectures being too fast in order to catch up with the class.",781,581,0,1,0.004264354705810547

630cf1c840e337e60fce274f,很喜歡老師這學期開的李商隱詩，真的學到很多東西，但最重要的我覺得是老師讓讀詩這件事變得更有深度更有趣，課程負擔不會到很重，推推,"I really like Li Shangyin's poems taught by the teacher this semester. I really learned a lot, but the most important thing I think is that the teacher makes reading poetry more in-depth and interesting. The course load will not be too heavy. Push it",1053,616,0,3,0.9963752627372742
630cf1c740e337e60fce25ec,老師上課偏題過於嚴重，詩選這門課應該是要能夠收穫滿滿的一堂必修，也應該是對學生影響甚大的一門課，可惜這學期老師上課幾乎都讓學生無法專注，學習不到東西，唯一的優點是老師感覺學識淵博，僅此而已。老師講義雖然發了很多，但是話語中瘋狂偏題，從各校老師的介紹講到他跟他老婆的相遇，雖然有趣，但很明顯對學術幫助不大，要多加注意。,"The teacher deviates too much from the topic in class. The Anthology of Poems should be a compulsory course that can yield a lot of rewards, and it should also be a course that has a great impact on students. Unfortunately, almost all of the teacher's classes this semester make students unable to concentrate and learn things. The only plus is that the teachers feel knowledgeable and nothing more. Although the teacher handed out a lot of handouts, the discourse was crazy off topic. From the introductions of the teachers in various schools to the encounter between him and his wife, although interesting, it is obviously not very helpful for academics, so we need to pay more attention.",900,754,0,1,0.0022562742233276367

630cf1c740e337e60fce2650,老師好我是宜佳，希望可以透過教學意見的管道向您道謝，真的很感謝老師兩學期以來很辛勤用心的教學，每次聽您上課前花了多少時間備課，都真的覺得很愧疚自己複習中會的時間遠不及您。很抱歉大二這年忙碌於系上事務及社團活動，很明顯地耽誤了學業，我其實也感到很無助且對自己很失望，覺得自己辜負了您的苦心。但上了您的課後我真的對會計燃起了更多的興趣，未來也希望可以在這個領域繼續努力，非常榮幸在大二這年當您的學生！謝謝老師！,"Hello, teacher. I am Yijia. I hope to thank you through the channel of teaching opinions. I really appreciate the teacher’s hard work and dedication in teaching in the past two semesters. Every time I hear how much time you spent preparing lessons before class, I really feel guilty. Your own review time will be far less than you. I am sorry that my sophomore year was busy with departmental affairs and club activities, which obviously delayed my studies. I actually felt helpless and disappointed in myself, and felt that I had failed your painstaking efforts. But after taking your class, I really became more interested in accounting, and I hope to continue to work hard in this field in the future. It is a great honor to be your student in my sophomore year! Thank you, teacher!",781,581,0,1,0.030068278312683105

630cf1c740e337e60fce25c0,建議老師可以提早說明期中報告的要求，讓同學有充分的時間準備，期中週還有其他的科目要讀，卻要趕在一週內產出期中報告。 除外，若有需要實地踏查的作業也希望老師可以提前二至三週說明，並不是每個同學假日都有閒置的時間可以運用。,"It is suggested that the teacher can explain the requirements of the mid-term report in advance, so that students have enough time to prepare. There are other subjects to study in the mid-term week, but they have to produce the mid-term report within a week. In addition, if there is an assignment that requires on-the-spot investigation, I hope the teacher can explain it two to three weeks in advance. Not every student has free time to use during their holidays.",823,596,0,2,0.00416797399520874
630cf1c740e337e60fce2611,希望每堂課之間可以休息10分鐘，晚下課的話就要晚一點開始上課,"I hope you can take a 10-minute break between each class. If you finish class late, you will start class later.",1050,756,0,1,0.9691490530967712
630cf1c740e337e60fce25bf,在期末報告前一週才臨時通知需要繳交書面報告，在這之前完全沒有旭明期末報告的形式、要求等，讓學生非常錯愕，在期末週實在是沒有充足的時間準備這項書面報告,"The written report was notified just one week before the final report. Before that, there was no form or requirement for Xuming's final report, which made the students very surprised. There was really not enough time to prepare the written report during the final week.",823,596,0,2,0.0019342303276062012

630cf1c840e337e60fce2754,老師上課非常認真，課前都花很多時間準備，甚至一讀再讀，為了帶給學生更豐富的閱讀體驗，理解古人的生平以及交織的情感歷程，因為修習這門課而讓我對閱讀詩有了新的體悟，可以從許多角度切入摸索，令我最印象深刻的是，老師說不要過度解讀，而是要融入美感的閱讀，第一次這樣學習讀詩，獲益良多，感觸很深，謝謝老師帶給我的影響,"The teacher is very serious in class, and spends a lot of time preparing before class, even reading and re-reading. In order to give students a richer reading experience, understand the life of the ancients and the intertwined emotional journey, because of taking this course, I am very interested in reading poetry. With a new understanding, I can explore from many angles. What impressed me the most is that the teacher said not to over-interpret, but to integrate aesthetic reading.

630cf1c740e337e60fce25ed,感覺得出老師知識淵博，但講課速度太快，容易偏離主題，對我而言跟得很吃力。也希望老師能在學期初就規劃好整個學期要講的內容，學生比較容易預習和複習。,"I feel that the teacher is very knowledgeable, but the lectures are too fast and easily deviate from the topic, which is very difficult for me to follow.

630cf1c740e337e60fce2609,希望老師能給學生完整的下課時間，有時候休息時間只夠去一趟洗手間就要繼續上課，會覺得有點筋疲力盡跟不上上課進度。也希望老師開放考試可以至少讓學生看法典，背法條感覺沒什麼意義。整體而言學到很多，謝謝老師。老師真的很認真有時還會備課到很晚或早起備課，辛苦老師了！,"I hope the teacher can give the students a complete time after class. Sometimes the rest time is only enough to go to the bathroom to continue the class, and I feel a little exhausted and unable to keep up with the progress of the class.

630cf1c840e337e60fce26bd,詞作賞析真的非常動人，作者心境透過老師講述躍然於紙上，讓這堂課似乎不僅僅是賞析詞作，而是看見人生中偶然或必然的領悟。,"The appreciation and analysis of the lyrics is really moving. The author's state of mind is vividly displayed on the paper through the teacher's narration, which makes this class seem to be not just about appreciation and analysis of the lyrics, but to see the accidental or inevitable insights in life.",773,616,0,1,0.9997915625572205
630cf1c840e337e60fce2786,教學進度安排應力求貼近教學現實，否則課程內容全數快速帶過，將嚴重影響學生學習成效。,"The teaching schedule should try to be close to the teaching reality, otherwise all the course content will be quickly taken over, which will seriously affect the learning effect of students.",988,755,0,1,0.0015823841094970703

630cf1c840e337e60fce2706,我認為老師有實體，遠距，跟非同步這三樣學習的方式很好很彈性，老師也講解的很清楚。周助教也非常用心的準備教材和上課。,"I think the teacher has physical, distance, and asynchronous learning methods, which are very good and flexible, and the teacher also explained it very clearly.

630cf1c840e337e60fce276d,老師講解可以再清楚一點，偶爾會支支吾吾，讓學生聽不太懂,"The teacher's explanation can be more clear, and occasionally he will hesitate, so that the students can't understand",648,618,0,1,0.0024932026863098145

630cf1c840e337e60fce2693,我個人希望課堂小考是檢查自己是否對這個觀念有了解，但如果題目的難度過高，反而無法達到原有的效果，可能會打擊學生信心、減少鑑別度等，希望小考難度做調整。,"I personally hope that the classroom quiz is to check whether I have an understanding of this concept, but if the difficulty of the questions is too high, it will not be able to achieve the original effect, which may damage students' confidence and reduce the degree of discrimination.

630cf1c840e337e60fce2785,建議老師上課前可以先提供PPT給學生，否則當課程的內容順序沒有直接對應到課本順序會使學生無法馬上知道老師在哪什麼部分，也會比較難做筆記。,"It is suggested that the teacher can provide PPT to the students before class, otherwise, if the order of the content of the course does not directly correspond to the order of the textbook, the students will not be able to immediately know which part the teacher is in, and it will be more difficult to take notes.",988,755,0,1,0.0003088712692260742

630cf1c840e337e60fce26e4,這學期修了兩門老師的課，真的是都超級喜歡老師的上課方式跟節奏。雖然我本身沒什麼程式經驗，但跟著老師的教學也完全可以跟上。有一個小小的建議就是希望老師在結束ppt內容進入程式教學之前，可以先放慢說明一下那一份程式碼的架構。不然總覺得一行一行看程式學到後來會感覺有點瑣碎，雖然知道用哪些代碼可以做些甚麼設定，但比較難貫通整份程式的撰寫目的跟期望得出什麼樣的結果（？）,"This semester, I took two courses from the teacher, and I really like the way and rhythm of the teacher's class. Although I have no programming experience, I can still keep up with the teacher's teaching. There is a small suggestion that I hope that the teacher can slow down and explain the structure of the program code before ending the ppt content and entering the program teaching. Otherwise, I always feel that it will be a bit trivial to read the program line by line. Although I know which codes can be used to make settings, it is difficult to understand the purpose of writing the entire program and what kind of results are expected (?)",1051,632,0,3,0.003798544406890869

In addition, the python explanation is clear, but You can explain how to use more functions Finally, the homework of the proof question is really difficult QQ, I almost quit QQ (but fortunately I survived)",1059,632,0,3,0.0014794468879699707

630cf1c840e337e60fce27eb,教超級好 深入淺出 只是教室可以選好一點的舒服一點的,"The teaching is super good and easy to understand, but the classroom can be better and more comfortable",286,617,0,1,0.9872031807899475
630cf1c840e337e60fce27b5,希望期初可以有syllabus可以參考，大部分時候都是老師每堂課開始用口頭講的（經常每週說的不一樣、老師說的跟助教寄信的又不一樣）關於平時作業方面的資訊蠻雜亂的,"I hope that there is a syllabus for reference at the beginning of the semester. Most of the time, the teacher gives oral lectures at the beginning of each class (often the words are different every week, and what the teacher says is different from what the teaching assistant sends.) The information about homework is pretty good. messy",524,607,0,1,0.9994018077850342

630cf1c840e337e60fce27ea,老師超讚，講解得很清楚，補足之前修財管不懂的地方，再延伸到投資學！很讚收益良多！,"The teacher is amazing, explaining very clearly, making up for what I didn't understand in financial management before, and then extending it to investment! Great income!",286,617,0,1,0.9998774528503418
630cf1c840e337e60fce27de,老師是天使～開玩笑的啦，很喜歡老師上課的節奏，雖然進度不算快但真的很紮實，提到某個實務見解的時候也會很詳細的把背景事實講清楚，讓我們比較好理解，一直以來都覺得公法是玄學，所以本來很怕行政法這堂課，但修了一年之後覺得非常滿足，因為老師總是能把抽象的概念講得很具體，所以這一年來真的學到很多東西！然後老師真的很溫柔很親切，不用擔心私下去問問題會被噹，這點真的超讚，希望以後還有機會修老師開的課～,"The teacher is an angel~ Just kidding, I really like the pace of the teacher's class. Although the progress is not fast, it is really solid. When a certain practical opinion is mentioned, the background facts will be explained in detail, so that we can understand it better. , I have always felt that public law is metaphysics, so I was afraid of the administrative law class, but after taking it for a year, I feel very satisfied, because the teacher can always explain abstract concepts in a concrete way, so I really learned a lot this year. a lot of things! Then the teacher is really gentle and kind, so you don’t have to worry about being taken for a private question.",772,606,0,2,0.999631404876709
630cf1c840e337e60fce27d5,很謝謝老師這一年的行政法教學（還是要再說一次老師聲音真的太好聽......），老師上課很清晰詳盡～ppt也很清楚，會在不同概念中穿插案例，讓我們更了解抽象觀念的應用。課輔也幫助學習行政法很多，好感謝老師幫我們找了這麼棒的助教！非常謝謝老師的教導～超喜歡老師！,"I am very grateful to the teacher for teaching administrative law this year (I have to say again that the teacher’s voice is really nice...), the teacher’s lectures are very clear and detailed~ the ppt is also very clear, and will intersperse cases in different concepts, let us Learn more about the application of abstract ideas.

630cf1c840e337e60fce27e5,老師用心教學，但考試及作業難度或許可以調低一點點,"The teacher is teaching hard, but the difficulty of exams and homework may be lowered a little bit",286,617,0,1,0.0018841028213500977
630cf1c840e337e60fce27d1,我覺得上老師果然還是要以實體的課程較為好因為老師總是可以在實體的課程當中掌握適當的速度以最佳的方式幫同學統整問題，透過與學生的互動，掌握觀念的澄清。而且老師總是以淺顯易懂的方式來向我們訴說博大精深的行政法問題最後希望未來還有機會可以修到靜惠老師的課，在這一年的學習當中從一剛開始完全不了解何為行政法到現在似乎已經可以稍微掌握行為形式的定性後去針對行政法的問題處理。,"I think it is better to use the physical courses for the teacher because the teacher can always grasp the appropriate speed in the physical courses to help the students organize the problems in the best way, and grasp the clarification of concepts through the interaction with the students. Moreover, the teacher always tells us the broad and profound administrative law issues in a simple and easy-to-understand way. Finally, I hope that I will have the opportunity to take the class of Teacher Jinghui in the future. From the beginning of this year's study, I didn't understand what administration is at all. Law seems to have been able to grasp the nature of the form of behavior to deal with the problems of administrative law.",772,606,0,2,0.9935653805732727
630cf1c840e337e60fce279f,老師人很好，講課都會帶到題目，方便理解，上課真的上很好，只不過老師的聲音對我來說有點催眠(對不起麗霞TT,"The teacher is very nice, and the lectures will be brought to the topic, which is easy to understand. The class is really good, but the teacher's voice is a bit hypnotic to me (sorry Lixia TT",792,623,0,1,0.9992817044258118
630cf1c840e337e60fce279b,老師的PPT真的很詳細，看後一看就懂，而且考試有努力就有分，給讚！,"The teacher's PPT is really detailed, you can understand it after reading it, and you will get points if you work hard in the exam, praise!",792,623,0,1,0.9996626377105713
630cf1c840e337e60fce2798,我覺得老師教得內容有點太多，吸收不了,"I think the content taught by the teacher is a bit too much, and I can't absorb it.",792,623,0,1,0.00024324655532836914
630cf1c840e337e60fce27dc,老師授課認真，會舉實務上案例幫助學習。助教也很用心整理講義與講解，每次TA課都是上好上滿，辛苦了！,"The teacher is serious in teaching and will give practical cases to help with learning. The teaching assistants are also very careful in organizing the handouts and explanations. Every time TA class is good and full, it's hard work!",772,606,0,2,0.9985563158988953

630cf1c840e337e60fce2793,希望上課的PPT可以呈現的更清楚！(因為沒有課本所以會不太知道從哪裡複習起) 謝謝老師這學期的教導！,"I hope that the PPT in class can be presented more clearly! (Because there is no textbook, I don't know where to start to review) Thank you teacher for teaching this semester!",856,755,0,3,0.998794674873352
630cf1c840e337e60fce27a5,教得很棒,great teaching,792,623,0,1,0.9998310804367065
630cf1c840e337e60fce27a8,老師上課蠻認真，也會注意學生的上課狀況，雖然有些人會覺得老師授課方式會有點無聊，但如果要應付考試，還是建議要做一些課本習題。另外，作業也記得要做，除了是固定分數，也可以強迫自己去複習內容，推麗霞 !,"The teacher is very serious in class and pays attention to the students' class status. Although some people think the teacher's teaching method is a bit boring, if you want to cope with the exam, it is recommended to do some textbook exercises. In addition, remember to do homework, in addition to fixed scores, you can also force yourself to review the content, push Lixia!",792,623,0,1,0.9892099499702454
630cf1c840e337e60fce27ec,老師把內容教得很清楚，讓學生可以簡單瞭解投資學知識，很喜歡老師遠距課程的處理方式，youtube錄影片的方式超讚的。然而上課節奏過慢經常讓學生沒有耐心聽下去，每周課程也花太多時間複習前一周的內容，希望老師未來可以花更多時間教新的東西，把複習的責任義務教給學生自己。除此之外，本學期有大量教學內容與上學期的財務管理課程重疊，希望老師可以事先了解重疊的部分，上課的時候快速帶過就好。,"The teacher taught the content very clearly, so that students can easily understand the knowledge of investment. I really like the way the teacher handles the distance courses. The way of recording videos on YouTube is amazing. However, the slow pace of the class often makes students impatient to listen, and the weekly class also spends too much time reviewing the content of the previous week. I hope that the teacher can spend more time teaching new things in the future, and teach the students the responsibility of reviewing themselves. In addition, a lot of teaching content in this semester overlaps with the financial management courses in last semester. I hope that the teacher can understand the overlapping parts in advance, so that you can quickly bring them to class.",286,617,0,1,0.13117623329162598
630cf1c840e337e60fce281e,老師平易近人，而且很關心學生。如果對課程內容有興趣的話，十分推薦來修這堂課。,"The teachers are approachable and care about the students. If you are interested in the course content, I highly recommend taking this course.",1058,619,3,2,0.9998034834861755
630cf1c840e337e60fce27b0,老師上課有點跳但真的很有料！非常專注就跟上老師，能吸收到很多新知識,"The teacher was a little jumpy in class but really very informative! Very focused and just keep up with the teacher, able to absorb a lot of new knowledge",524,607,0,1,0.9997972846031189

630cf1c840e337e60fce2807,老師對國際租稅相當有熱忱，很佩服老師能將那麼廣泛及複雜的知識，有系統地編撰成講義。謝謝老師~,"The teacher is very enthusiastic about international taxation, and I admire the teacher's ability to systematically compile such extensive and complex knowledge into lecture notes. Thank you teacher~",1057,618,0,3,0.9997474551200867
630cf1c840e337e60fce27d3,老師上課口條清晰，簡報內容也很豐富，是一位認真的老師!但是不給簡報，加上行政法蠻抽象的，沒有平板上課會很痛苦，畢竟邊聽邊抄筆記效果不會好><,"The teacher speaks clearly in class, and the content of the briefing is also very rich. He is a serious teacher! However, no briefing is given, and the administrative law is quite abstract. It will be very painful to attend class without a tablet. After all, copying notes while listening will not be effective > <",772,606,0,2,0.9537672400474548
630cf1c840e337e60fce2808,真的很喜歡上老師的課，謝謝老師的用心教學！,"I really like the teacher's class, thank you for your hard work!",1057,618,0,3,0.9998375177383423
630cf1c840e337e60fce27e2,可以的話，減少上課學生數，然後再方便討論的教室上課，畢竟這算是一種seminar，學生應該是要多講話的,"If possible, reduce the number of students in class, and then teach in a classroom that is convenient for discussion. After all, this is a kind of seminar, and students should talk more",1060,604,0,2,0.018527865409851074
630cf1c840e337e60fce27d7,老師上課內容豐富且扎實，難過的是後來遠距教學，希望未來仍有機會爭取老師在課堂上高歌一曲!這是我畢生的願望,"The content of the teacher's class is rich and solid, but the sad thing is that the distance teaching later, I hope that in the future I will still have the opportunity to fight for the teacher to sing in class! This is my lifelong wish",772,606,0,2,0.9979575872421265
630cf1c840e337e60fce27cc,這學期修了兩門老師的課，真的是都超級喜歡老師的上課方式跟節奏。雖然我本身沒什麼程式經驗，但跟著老師的教學也完全可以跟上。有一個小小的建議就是希望老師在結束ppt內容進入程式教學之前，可以先放慢說明一下那一份程式碼的架構。不然總覺得一行一行看程式學到後來會感覺有點瑣碎，雖然知道用哪些代碼可以做些甚麼設定，但比較難貫通整份程式的撰寫目的跟期望得出什麼樣的結果（？）,"This semester, I took two courses from the teacher, and I really like the way and rhythm of the teacher's class. Although I have no programming experience, I can still keep up with the teacher's teaching. There is a small suggestion that I hope that the teacher can slow down and explain the structure of the program code before ending the ppt content and entering the program teaching. Otherwise, I always feel that it will be a bit trivial to read the program line by line. Although I know which codes can be used to make settings, it is difficult to understand the purpose of writing the entire program and what kind of results are expected (?)",1059,632,0,3,0.003798544406890869
630cf1c840e337e60fce27cb,老師很認真，講解很清楚，講完一部分也會停下來問同學有沒有意見，作業壓力也不會太大，非常感謝老師的教導，辛苦了。,"The teacher is very serious, and the explanation is very clear. After a part of the lecture, he will stop to ask the students if they have any comments. The homework pressure will not be too much. Thank you very much for the teacher's teaching.",1059,632,0,3,0.9995704293251038

630cf1c840e337e60fce27d4,老師的聲音很好聽，教學時還會提醒我們一些答題技巧。 簡報清楚明瞭但仍希望老師能多給一些參考資料。,"The teacher's voice is very nice, and he will remind us some answering skills when teaching. The briefing is clear but I still hope that the teacher can give some more reference materials.",772,606,0,2,0.9994164705276489

630cf1c840e337e60fce2903,老師教得很好，這堂課真的讓我收穫豐富！尤其個案討論的部份，討論前和討論後完全是兩個世界，到後半學期我才比較知道要如何分析。謝謝老師～,"The teacher taught very well, and this class really enriched me!

630cf1c840e337e60fce28c9,除了考試偏難(期中超過一半不及格)，但只要認真讀書，真的是我目前遇見最好的刑法老師,"In addition to the difficult exams (more than half of the mid-term failed), but as long as you study hard, you are really the best criminal law teacher I have ever met.",873,762,0,1,0.9998137354850769
630cf1c840e337e60fce28de,老師上課時有問我們上學期的期末考考法，聽完後說:那太好了，因為我的考卷裡也不會有選擇題。我還以為考法跟上學期一樣，結果期中考有一半的分數都是簡答題。如果老師有要繼續開課，我想老師你可以在考試前詳細說明考卷配分，不然老師你教得這麼完整，比上學期的老師教得更多，卻因為這種可避免的理由而讓人不敢選課也太可惜了。,"During class, the teacher asked us about the final exam method of last semester. After listening to it, he said: That's great, because there will be no multiple choice questions in my exam paper. I thought the test method was the same as last semester, but half of the scores in the midterm test were short answer questions. If the teacher wants to continue the class, I think you can explain the distribution of the test papers in detail before the exam, otherwise, the teacher taught so completely and taught more than the teacher in the previous semester, but because of this avoidable reason, it makes people uncomfortable. It's a pity to dare to choose a class.",873,762,0,1,0.0021890997886657715
630cf1c840e337e60fce2984,老師很好，教的內容也很好，但是因為內容比較複雜，真的請！！每一堂課都錄影吧，很想用錄影的方式多多複習，如果這堂課能像應數系的課一樣有錄影的話我會超感激，增加學習吸收的成效。 錄影錄影錄影錄影！辛苦老師一學期的教導，謝謝老師。,"The teacher is very good, and the content of the teaching is also very good, but because the content is more complicated, please really! ! Let’s video every class. I really want to use video to review more.

630cf1c940e337e60fce29d5,謝謝老師。 但如果期末報告的評分標準檔案可以更早給更好，對於檔案中的各項定義也希望能早一點說明清楚，才不會在這個報告花太多時間把原本做的東西改掉。 期末報告很吃組員大家自求多福。,"Thank you, teacher. However, it would be better if the scoring standard file for the final report could be given earlier, and I hope that the definitions in the file can be clarified earlier, so as not to spend too much time in this report to change the original things.

630cf1c840e337e60fce297e,數統實在不是一門好修的課，可以看出來老師真的滿有熱忱，但可能我程度比較不好，覺得有點吃力。,"Mathematics is really not an easy course to take. It can be seen that the teacher is really enthusiastic, but maybe my level is not good enough and I feel a little difficult.",1062,648,0,1,0.0011414289474487305

630cf1c840e337e60fce2869,我覺得老師上課時可以盡量避免過多的語助詞、贅字以及結巴，以至於模糊上課的焦點，並且希望老師可以加深以及補充課程相關內容，以避免大部分課程過於雷同高中公民課。,"I think the teacher can try to avoid too many auxiliary words, superfluous words and stuttering in class, so as to blur the focus of the class, and I hope the teacher can deepen and supplement the relevant content of the course so that most courses are not too similar to high school civics courses.",659,633,0,1,0.0018977522850036621
630cf1c840e337e60fce2846,感覺這次比往年少上了很多內容，可能因為堂數變少，蠻失望的，但推推老師。,"I feel that there is a lot less content this time than in previous years. It may be because the number of classes has decreased, which is quite disappointing, but I recommend it to the teacher.",239,605,0,1,0.9957032799720764
630cf1c940e337e60fce29cd,覺得可選擇的實習機構應該早點公布，或者改成上學期開課，讓學生有充分的時間考慮是否修課、或是自行聯絡其他機構。,"I feel that the optional internship institutions should be announced earlier, or the courses should be changed to the last semester, so that students have enough time to consider whether to take courses, or contact other institutions on their own.",1067,662,0,3,0.0003940463066101074
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a2a,這堂課的課程內容在勞動經濟學中算是非常基礎的，但也教得非常的紮實。 若只由課程講義及筆記準備考試會覺得不知所措，所幸教授每次考試前都會提供考古題，比較有準備的頭緒。,"The course content of this class is very basic in labor economics, but it is also very solid. If you only use the lecture notes and notes to prepare for the exam, you will feel overwhelmed. Fortunately, the professor will provide archaeological questions before each exam, so you can prepare better.",1068,675,3,3,0.9994615912437439
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a31,老師教的很好,The teacher taught very well,758,670,0,1,0.9997695088386536
630cf1c940e337e60fce29d4,課程後半段的退休規劃建議有修過「社會保險」的人再來修這堂，要不然會聽不懂在講什麼...,"For the retirement planning in the second half of the course, it is recommended that those who have taken ""social insurance"" take this course again, otherwise they will not understand what they are talking about...",1064,664,0,3,0.011044085025787354
630cf1c840e337e60fce2919,老師只來上一堂人力資源管理好可惜 內容和時間掌控都超讚的！,It's a pity that the teacher only came to the human resource management class. The content and time control are superb!,9,655,0,1,0.9988784193992615
630cf1c840e337e60fce2914,老師提出許多理論在實際應用例子，讓我感到管理學這門學科親近許多。謝謝老師！,"The teacher put forward many examples of theoretical application in practice, which made me feel that the subject of management is much closer. Thank you, teacher!",9,655,0,1,0.9996997117996216
630cf1c840e337e60fce297d,上課內容太過重視公式推導，以致在實際運用上非常不熟練。遠距時老師太快把白板上的字擦掉，筆記來不及抄。,"The content of the class pays too much attention to the derivation of formulas, so that it is very unskilled in practical application. When the teacher is far away, the teacher erases the words on the whiteboard too quickly, and the notes are too late to copy.",1062,648,0,1,0.00048661231994628906
630cf1c840e337e60fce28ca,士軒一生推!雖然期末範圍爆炸多但老師教學品質高、內容充實，值得修的課,"Shixuan recommends it for a lifetime! Although the scope of the final semester exploded, the teacher's teaching quality is high, the content is substantial, and the course is worth taking",873,762,0,1,0.9998024106025696
630cf1c840e337e60fce2931,我覺得課程一開始在理論授課時可以一邊開始進行口述歷史實作，不然到後面做都太敢，而且受訪者實在是太難找了實作一二要在短時間完成實在太困難了QQ,"I think the oral history practice can be started during the theoretical teaching at the beginning of the course, otherwise it would be too daring to do it later, and it is too difficult for the interviewees to find the practice one or two. It is too difficult to complete it in a short time QQ",1069,651,0,2,0.0003420114517211914
630cf1c840e337e60fce2983,老師真的教的超棒，謝謝老師，辛苦了！,"The teacher is really good at teaching, thank you teacher, you have worked hard!",1062,648,0,1,0.9998002648353577
630cf1c840e337e60fce28e7,因為老師不常開系上的課，所以有種相見恨晚的感覺，真的好喜歡莉芬的課！每週的讀書心得有交有分，個人覺得沒有想像中那麼重，但建議大二以上再來修神話會比較有收穫，也可以跟其他課連結！,"Because the teacher doesn't give the department's class very often, so I feel like I've seen each other late. I really like Li Fen's class! The weekly reading experience is shared and shared. I personally think it is not as important as I imagined, but I suggest that it will be more rewarding to study mythology after the sophomore year, and it can also be connected with other courses!",1070,764,0,2,0.9928792119026184
630cf1c940e337e60fce29a9,老師辛苦了！小班上課其實學到蠻多的！,"The teacher has worked hard! In small classes, I actually learned a lot!",547,765,0,2,0.9983539581298828
630cf1c940e337e60fce29a2,老師上課很認真，會根據指定閱讀材料鼓勵學生思考、發言，考試難度也適當，我本來以為跟思想有關的課程會很枯燥，但這學期上完老師的課後收穫頗多!,"The teacher is very serious in class, and will encourage students to think and speak according to the assigned reading materials, and the difficulty of the exam is also appropriate. I thought that the courses related to thinking would be boring, but after taking the teacher's class this semester, I learned a lot!",1071,657,0,2,0.9948300719261169
630cf1c840e337e60fce2864,希望可以改變期末團體報告的形式。大一學生普遍沒有修過社研法，而教授和助教也沒有花足夠的時間講述撰寫這種報告的方法，讓人在撰寫的時候常常感覺自己的學術能力很不足，卻又只能透過自學來勉強應付。而且團體報告讓人花很多時間在與同學溝通，連助教課關於上課內容的討論時間都會被團體報告進度討論擠壓到，實在很可惜。,"It is hoped that the format of the end-of-term group report can be changed. First-year students generally have not studied social research law, and professors and teaching assistants have not spent enough time explaining the method of writing this kind of report. When writing, people often feel that their academic ability is insufficient, but they can only learn through self-study. Come to barely cope. Moreover, the group report makes people spend a lot of time communicating with classmates, and even the discussion time of the teaching assistant class on the content of the class will be squeezed by the progress discussion of the group report, which is really a pity.",659,633,0,1,0.00029081106185913086
630cf1c840e337e60fce2832,希望能在課程大綱就把報告的主題、要求都寫詳細,I hope that the topics and requirements of the report can be written in detail in the syllabus.,960,624,0,1,0.7662128806114197
630cf1c840e337e60fce2817,老師應該讓學生更有自己的意見或讓學生完整報告內容，而不是期待報告內容方式簡報都照老師的方式,"Teachers should allow students to have their own opinions or let students complete the report content, instead of expecting the report content and presentation to follow the teacher's way",1072,569,0,3,0.9292519092559814
630cf1c840e337e60fce288f,建議老師可以增加課程講授的文章，一週一篇左右可能有點不夠紮實,"It is suggested that the teacher can increase the articles taught in the course, about one article a week may not be solid enough",796,643,0,1,0.00022286176681518555
630cf1c840e337e60fce286c,老師的上課內容很有趣而且也能增進學生對社會學的興趣，但還是老師上課有時候講得不太順,"The content of the teacher's class is very interesting and can also enhance students' interest in sociology, but sometimes the teacher's class is not smooth",659,633,0,1,0.24365264177322388
630cf1c840e337e60fce285e,老師對學生很好、很親切，也很尊重大家意見。一學期四篇作文、四周一篇的循環很剛好，檢討、訂正作文的方式也很清楚，對作文的學習很有幫助。老師在政大第一年開課辛苦了，學到很多東西!,"The teachers are very kind and kind to the students, and they respect everyone's opinions. The cycle of four essays in one semester and one essay in four weeks is very good, and the method of reviewing and correcting essays is also very clear, which is very helpful for the study of essays. The teacher worked hard in the first year of National Chengchi University and learned a lot!",85,641,2,1,0.9997641444206238
630cf1c840e337e60fce2841,鎮洲就是讚 助教學姊也讚,"Zhenzhou is the sponsor, and the teaching sister also likes it",239,605,0,1,0.999683141708374
630cf1c940e337e60fce29db,老師上課幽默風趣而且會用不同方式說明課程內容，使學生對有些枯燥的內容也能比較好理解。,"The teacher is humorous and funny in class and will explain the course content in different ways, so that students can understand the boring content better.",648,659,0,1,0.9922109842300415
630cf1c940e337e60fce29d0,期末的報告很有趣，可以更有接近實務的感覺，同時看到別組的作品、或是得到老師對於自己組的報告的建議，也更能夠了解自己需要加強的部分是甚麼。,"The end-of-term report is very interesting, and it can feel closer to practice. At the same time, seeing the works of other groups, or getting suggestions from the teacher for the report of your own group, you can better understand what you need to strengthen.",1064,664,0,3,0.9970857501029968

630cf1c840e337e60fce290d,老師上課非常用心！但希望遠距上課也能有板書協助公式推導的理解～,The teacher is very attentive in class! But I hope that there will be blackboard writing to assist in the understanding of formula derivation in remote classes~,239,766,0,3,0.35369670391082764
630cf1c840e337e60fce28c7,老師是暖男，暈了,"The teacher is a warm man, dizzy",873,762,0,1,0.9997479319572449

630cf1c840e337e60fce2982,感受到老師對數學的熱忱，但希望老師上課能多點觀念的闡述，調整課程的難易度，不要著重過多數學的證明。,"I feel the teacher's enthusiasm for mathematics, but I hope that the teacher can explain more ideas in class, adjust the difficulty of the course, and don't focus too much on mathematical proofs.",1062,648,0,1,0.9914769530296326
630cf1c840e337e60fce28d7,希望老師能留在政大久一點!,I hope the teacher can stay in Zhengda University for a long time!,873,762,0,1,0.6512227058410645

630cf1c840e337e60fce2953,喜歡老師上課時結合許多時事或案例進行講解，有助於理解課程，謝謝,"I like the teacher's explanations in combination with many current events or cases in class, which is helpful for understanding the course, thank you",1002,647,0,1,0.9997617602348328
630cf1c940e337e60fce2997,謝謝老師,"Thank you, teacher",225,763,0,1,0.999835729598999

630cf1c940e337e60fce29ad,老師很棒,great teacher,112,658,0,1,0.9998414516448975
630cf1c940e337e60fce29af,上課內容很充實，整學期下來獲益良多，謝謝老師！,"The content of the class is very substantial, and I have benefited a lot throughout the semester, thank you teacher!",112,658,0,1,0.9998738765716553
630cf1c840e337e60fce2863,希望老師在解釋專有名詞或理論時，文句能更有條理一些，以助學生理解。,"I hope that when the teacher explains proper nouns or theories, the sentences can be more organized to help students understand.",659,633,0,1,0.001967012882232666
630cf1c840e337e60fce2877,老師真的很善良也很親切，就算程度不好也會給與耐心指導！,"The teacher is really kind and kind, even if the level is not good, he will give patient guidance!",66,641,0,1,0.9996803998947144
630cf1c840e337e60fce283f,老師很認真，也將觀念講解得很清楚，很喜歡老師的上課方式！遠距教學的配套措施是我所修過的課堂中最完善的，老師辛苦了！,The teacher is very serious and explains the concepts very clearly. I really like the way the teacher teaches! The supporting measures for distance teaching are the most complete in the classrooms I have studied. The teacher has worked hard!,239,605,0,1,0.9997156262397766
630cf1c840e337e60fce2847,謝謝老師提供多元彈性的上課方式及考試方式讓學生選擇，在疫情之下真的很感恩～,Thank you teacher for providing diverse and flexible teaching methods and examination methods for students to choose. I am really grateful under the epidemic~,239,605,0,1,0.9997931122779846
630cf1c940e337e60fce29da,這學期謝謝老師的教導，考試也不會給學生過多的壓力，會不斷提醒助教不要出太難。但希望老師如果進度太慢的話還是可以不要趕課，可以調整授課範圍，而不要只是帶過，因為其實還是想要更深入了解課程內容。謝謝老師，辛苦了！,"Thanks to the teachers for their guidance this semester, the exams will not put too much pressure on the students, and I will keep reminding the teaching assistants not to be too difficult. But I hope that if the teacher's progress is too slow, he can stop rushing the class and adjust the scope of the teaching instead of just passing it, because in fact, he still wants to understand the course content more deeply. Thank you, teacher, for your hard work!",648,659,0,1,0.9966427087783813
630cf1c840e337e60fce2904,老師的產業知識十分豐富，在加上含括多種產業面向的個案，在這堂課可以增加很多很扎實的產業知識，同時，在分析個案時也會常常使用策略分析的架構，幫助我記憶並應用理論架構。 上課時老師會隨機抽問，我蠻喜歡這種上課方式的，一方面增加自己的專心程度，一方面在被點到時逼自己快速反應。 總體而言，很推薦大家來修~,"The teacher's industry knowledge is very rich. In addition to the cases that include various industries, I can add a lot of solid industry knowledge in this class. At the same time, I often use the framework of strategic analysis when analyzing cases, which helps me remember and Applied theoretical framework. During class, the teacher will randomly ask questions. I really like this way of teaching. On the one hand, it increases my concentration, and on the other hand, it forces myself to respond quickly when I am called out. Overall, I highly recommend everyone to fix it~",225,654,0,1,0.9997251629829407
630cf1c840e337e60fce28c6,真的超愛上老師的課*｡٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و*｡ 好喜歡老師嚴謹的教學內容和可愛的圖畫，希望下學期可以上到老師開的刑法三QQ,I really fell in love with the teacher's class *｡٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و*｡ I really like the teacher's rigorous teaching content and cute pictures. I hope I can go to the criminal law three QQ opened by the teacher next semester,873,762,0,1,0.9995935559272766
630cf1c840e337e60fce28db,很喜歡老師讓我們表現自己的想法，但考試的簡答題有點困難,"I really like the idea that the teacher asked us to express our own ideas, but the short answer questions in the exam are a bit difficult",873,762,0,1,0.0020407438278198242
630cf1c840e337e60fce2930,老師上課超棒的，內容很豐富，搭配實作課程受益更多。,"The teacher's class is excellent, the content is very rich, and it will benefit more with practical courses.",1069,651,0,2,0.9998199343681335
630cf1c840e337e60fce28da,很喜歡老師的教學方式！老師教授的內容非常完整，會補充各學說見解，還會舉很多例子讓學生了解,"I love the way the teacher teaches! The content taught by the teacher is very complete, will supplement the theoretical insights, and will give many examples to let students understand",873,762,0,1,0.9998418092727661
630cf1c840e337e60fce294c,老師備課、講課認真，講解很清楚！不過時常有遠距上課操作上的問題，建議老師有空閒時可以再多研究一下。,"The teacher prepares lessons, lectures carefully, and explains clearly! However, there are often problems in the operation of remote classes. It is recommended that teachers can study more when they have free time.",1002,647,0,1,0.6117345094680786
630cf1c940e337e60fce299d,教學很用心，但我覺得第一堂課不用發紙本的課綱，因為也不是依照上面的內容，很浪費紙。然後課程時常會延後這件事情，我覺得可以在課綱上稍微註明一下。因為這會影響到同學排課的策略，排課是一個系統性的安排，也有選課順序的策略考量，如果在一開始沒有提供足夠清楚的訊息，會讓同學在排課上有很大的困擾。然後希望老師在最後一堂課可以跟所有人明確說明，之後會開不同名字和課綱但是內容一樣的課，請大家不要選。不然像學期初還有幾個人不知道結果被老師請走，如果是我一定很困擾，因為這一樣打亂我的選課安排。,"The teaching is very attentive, but I feel that there is no need to distribute the paper syllabus for the first class, because it does not follow the above content, which is a waste of paper. Then the course often postpones this matter. I think it can be noted in the syllabus. This is because it will affect students’ course scheduling strategies. Course scheduling is a systematic arrangement, and there are also strategic considerations for the order of course selection. If you do not provide enough clear information at the beginning, students will have great troubles in arranging courses. Then I hope that the teacher can clearly explain to everyone in the last class that there will be classes with different names and syllabus but the same content, please don’t choose. Otherwise, at the beginning of the semester, there were a few people who didn’t know the result and were asked to leave by the teacher. If it was me, I must be very troubled, because this disrupted my course selection arrangement.",1073,768,0,3,0.0008599758148193359
630cf1c940e337e60fce2994,很喜歡老師帶者我們進行個案討論，可是常常覺得前面花太多時間，導致有些個案後面的題目(常常是未來策略的選擇等等)都沒有時間去討論跟思考。線上上課後，可以減少小組討論時間，因為時間總是不太夠，加上比起花很多時間聽同學分享更希望是老師帶者我們去想。但是仍然是一堂很豐富的課。,"I really like the teacher to lead us to conduct case discussions, but I often feel that too much time is spent in the front, resulting in some cases with no time to discuss and think about the topics behind some cases (often the choice of future strategies, etc.). After online classes, the group discussion time can be reduced, because there is always not enough time, and I hope that the teacher will lead us to think about it rather than spending a lot of time listening to classmates' sharing. But still a very rich class.",225,763,0,1,0.9686930775642395
630cf1c840e337e60fce288d,老師不同於中文系其他老師，用很自由且較非傳統的方式講課，而且還會根據選文內容適時補充自身經歷，很有趣。,"The teacher is different from other teachers in the Chinese Department. He lectures in a very free and non-traditional way, and also supplements his own experience in due course according to the content of the selected texts, which is very interesting.",796,643,0,1,0.9951850771903992
630cf1c940e337e60fce29cb,透過這堂課的實習活動，讓我對於公行領域的知識有更多的連結，很高興可以選上這堂課！,"Through the internship activities in this class, I have more connections with the knowledge in the public sector. I am very happy to choose this class!",1067,662,0,3,0.999771773815155
630cf1c940e337e60fce29c9,很喜歡這堂！,I like this class very much!,1067,662,0,3,0.9998669624328613
630cf1c840e337e60fce2973,很好了,Very good,1074,651,0,2,0.9998520612716675
630cf1c840e337e60fce28ae,老師有時會分享一些日本當地的語言用法和生活習慣等，這部分我覺得很有趣，同時也增加上課的樂趣。,"Sometimes the teacher will share some Japanese local language usage and living habits, etc. I find this part very interesting, and it also increases the fun of class.",323,641,0,1,0.9996726512908936
630cf1c840e337e60fce294b,老師提供的文本包含不同的觀點和立場，可以從各個角度認識歷史。,"The texts provided by the teacher contain different viewpoints and positions, and history can be understood from various angles.",1002,647,0,1,0.9971537590026855
630cf1c840e337e60fce2893,我認爲同學們的報告時間和討論時間有點捉摸不定；有些太長真的無法集中注意力，需要擬定時間；聼同學導讀的期間往往就能用掉兩節課以上的時間，剩下的基本就是在討論......,"I think the students' report time and discussion time are a bit unpredictable; some of them are too long to concentrate and need to draw up a time; listening to students' guidance can often take more than two classes, and the rest is basically Just discussing...",1066,656,0,1,0.0009292364120483398
630cf1c940e337e60fce299a,謝謝老師這學期的教導！我獲益良多！除了學到有關企業做策略規劃上可以運用的架構外，也在老師的引導下越來越敢於嘗試發表自己的想法，另外，搭配許多個案穿插學習，讓我們更能將上課所學予以應用，也對學理上的知識架構有更深一層的了解！能在畢業前修到這門課，成為老師的學生，我真的很幸運！謝謝老師！辛苦了！,"Thank you teacher for teaching this semester! I have benefited a lot! In addition to learning about the structure that can be used in corporate strategic planning, under the guidance of the teacher, I am more and more daring to try to express my own ideas. In addition, with many case studies, we can better apply what we have learned in class. Have a deeper understanding of the academic knowledge structure! I am truly lucky to be able to take this course and become a teacher's student before graduation! Thank you, teacher! Thanks for your hard work!",225,763,0,1,0.9998076558113098
630cf1c840e337e60fce2891,老師人很好，基本上世界的民族實在太多元，老師只能以典型的民族來介紹，也讓我們去認識到不同的文化。每周的作業量不大，老師給我們很大的自由來選擇想要寫的內容，讓我們對該民族有所啟發。  不過美中不足的部分，希望老師能夠對課程有更深入的內容，以至於不讓課程乏味。,"The teacher is very kind. Basically, there are too many ethnic groups in the world. The teacher can only introduce typical ethnic groups and let us understand different cultures. The amount of homework per week is not large, and the teacher gave us a lot of freedom to choose what we want to write, so that we can inspire the nation. But the fly in the ointment, I hope the teacher can have a more in-depth content of the course, so that the course will not be boring.",1066,656,0,1,0.9963260293006897
630cf1c840e337e60fce288e,我覺得老師的跨界展演報告的發想是非常立意良善的，中文系的學生不應只是局限在自己的領域裡鑽研經籍知識，而是能夠培養一個專業結合媒體或其他領域的學習方式，激盪了學生的想像力，跳脫以往報告只是用ppt、期末作業只是書寫小論文或讀書心得的窠臼。在此課堂上，因為報告所需，我接觸到了以往所不熟悉的影片剪輯部分，也算是課程之外的自主學習之一，獲益良多。,"I think the teacher's cross-border performance report is very well-intentioned. Students in the Chinese Department should not only study scripture knowledge in their own field, but can cultivate a professional learning method combined with media or other fields. It stimulates the imagination of the students, and breaks away from the previous stereotype that the report is just a ppt, and the final assignment is just writing a small paper or reading experience. In this class, because of the need for the report, I was exposed to the part of film editing that I was not familiar with before, which can be regarded as one of the independent learning outside the course, and I benefited a lot.",796,643,0,1,0.9990444779396057
630cf1c940e337e60fce29b5,名聖總經第一人選，絕對推推。下學期希望再一次修到老師的課,"The number one candidate for the Holy Scriptures, absolutely recommended. I hope to take the teacher's class again next semester",112,658,0,1,0.9997058510780334

630cf1c840e337e60fce28f2,老師人很願意為同學示範，但可能因為同學人數較多，就時常感到照顧不暇。在黑板上講解如何書寫還是硬筆操作，理解上不如軟筆來得直接，或許老師在製作教材時可以實錄一次毛筆的書寫過程。最後對於評分標準個人覺得稍微有點難捉摸。,"Teachers are willing to demonstrate for their classmates, but they often feel overwhelmed because of the large number of classmates. Explaining how to write on the blackboard is still the operation of hard pens. The understanding is not as direct as soft pens. Perhaps the teacher can record the writing process of brushes when making teaching materials.

630cf1c840e337e60fce2918,老師上課很用心，也很鼓勵大家發言級組內討論，且上課內容有趣。,"The teacher is very attentive in class, and encourages everyone to speak and discuss in the group, and the content of the class is interesting.",9,655,0,1,0.9997944235801697

630cf1c840e337e60fce2902,很喜歡老師帶者我們進行個案討論，可是常常覺得前面花太多時間，導致有些個案後面的題目(常常是未來策略的選擇等等)都沒有時間去討論跟思考。線上上課後，可以減少小組討論時間，因為時間總是不太夠，加上比起花很多時間聽同學分享更希望是老師帶者我們去想。但是仍然是一堂很豐富的課。,"I really like the teacher to lead us to conduct case discussions, but I often feel that too much time is spent in the front, resulting in some cases with no time to discuss and think about the topics behind some cases (often the choice of future strategies, etc.). After online classes, the group discussion time can be reduced, because there is always not enough time, and I hope that the teacher will lead us to think about it rather than spending a lot of time listening to classmates' sharing. But still a very rich class.",225,654,0,1,0.9686930775642395

630cf1c840e337e60fce28d9,我認為老師的教學方式有讓我更好的把書中的知識轉換成實際遇到問題的解決方式，雖然我在考試中取得的成績常常不夠理想，但那也是我自己的努力不夠,"I think the teacher's teaching method allows me to better convert the knowledge in the book into the solution to the actual problems encountered.

630cf1c840e337e60fce2951,黃老師的上課次數不多，但上課內容還算豐富，且有提供紙本講義，這點我認為非常滿意。不過可能因為是歷史課，內容還是有些無聊，或許可以增加一些趣味性，另外上課能夠發言的機會實在不多，因此應該把發言比例降低，改為繳交心得等方式，否則這部分的成績很難拿到。感謝老師辛苦的教導。,"Mr. Huang does not have many classes, but the content of the class is quite rich, and there are paper handouts, which I am very satisfied with. However, it may be because it is a history class, the content is still a bit boring, maybe it can be more interesting, and there are not many opportunities to speak in class, so the proportion of speeches should be reduced and handed in. Otherwise, the grades in this part will be very low. hard to get. Thank you teacher for your hard work.",1002,647,0,1,0.1553199291229248
630cf1c840e337e60fce2950,奎博老師的文本都很有料，老師上課也很認真，給了我許多不同觀點!,"Teacher Kui Bo's texts are very informative, and the teacher is also very serious in class, giving me many different perspectives!",1002,647,0,1,0.9997954964637756
630cf1c940e337e60fce299c,要對英文文法（關代關副，倒裝...）有基礎掌握，不然會念不下去，因為上課是唸原文，老師抽點人翻譯、解釋，其他人自由回覆，來回對答。這門課優點是可以練習鑽研文本，架構抽象概念，長時間保持高專注，表達意見與有效討論（提出確切且有說服力理由）。但討論品質與強度主要取決於修課同學的程度，所以要看運氣。可惜的是上課比較像在解析文本，但我會期待針對文本反向的、開放的討論。不過也可理解以授課時數來說有點難加入這部分。老師很親切，鼓勵同學但也會明確指錯。幾次被老師推著超越原本所及，滿過癮！,"It is necessary to have a basic grasp of English grammar (Guan Dai Guan Fu, inversion...), otherwise you will not be able to continue reading, because the class is to read the original text, the teacher selects some people to translate and explain, and others are free to answer and answer back and forth. The advantage of this course is that you can practice studying texts, structuring abstract concepts, maintaining high concentration for a long time, expressing opinions and discussing effectively (presenting precise and convincing reasons). But the quality and intensity of the discussion mainly depends on the level of the students taking the course, so it depends on luck. It's a pity that the class is more like parsing text, but I would look forward to a reverse, open discussion on the text. However, it is also understandable that it is a bit difficult to join this part in terms of the number of teaching hours. The teacher is very kind, encourages students but also clearly points out mistakes. I was pushed by the teacher several times to surpass what I could have done, which is very enjoyable!",1073,768,0,3,0.9888172149658203
630cf1c840e337e60fce2867,希望可以減少報告負荷量 希望老師在講重點時可以放慢速度 老師辛苦了！,I hope that the report load can be reduced. I hope that the teacher can slow down when explaining the key points. Teacher has worked hard!,659,633,0,1,0.011655211448669434

630cf1c840e337e60fce286d,要認真上每一堂課，老師考試會考一些ppt上沒有的東西。報告有點份量太重，同時還要寫英文閱讀的心得，期中期末也沒有考古題，考題不易。,"You must take every class seriously, and the teacher will test some things that are not on the ppt. The report is a bit too heavy, and at the same time, it is necessary to write about the experience of reading in English. There are no archaeological questions at the end of the midterm, and the exam questions are not easy.",659,633,0,1,0.001056373119354248
630cf1c940e337e60fce29b3,希望老師在詢問同學問題時，能夠給予明確的指示，讓同學了解要回答的答案是什麼，對於回答錯誤的同學可以給予鼓勵，讓同學有信心學習。,"I hope that the teacher can give clear instructions when asking students questions, so that students can understand what the answer is, and encourage students who answer incorrectly, so that students can learn with confidence.",112,658,0,1,0.9990260601043701
630cf1c940e337e60fce29b4,我覺得老師上課十分認真，在觀念部分也有好好讓我們了解每一條式子的由來與原因，大概只要有來上課，考古題的就大致寫得出來，只有小考部分也很讚，壓力不會那麼大，範圍比較小也會讓人比較有唸書的意願，謝謝老師一年來的教導，讓我對總體經濟學仍保有興趣。,"I think the teacher is very serious in class, and in the concept part, he also let us understand the origin and reason of each formula. Probably as long as he comes to class, the archeology questions can be roughly written. Only the quiz part is also very good, and the pressure will not be high. It is so big and the scope is relatively small, which will also make people more willing to study.

In addition to putting forward his own reflection on a certain article in class, he will also encourage students to participate in extracurricular art and cultural activities.

630cf1c840e337e60fce2906,老師上課的架構很清楚，但因為上課時間不夠，經常講不完該節主題（尤其是個案討論），比較可惜,"The structure of the teacher's class is very clear, but because of the lack of class time, he often can't finish the topic of the section (especially the case discussion), which is a pity",225,654,0,1,0.0004634857177734375
630cf1c840e337e60fce28cf,這麼說好了，雖然法律系大多沒有修過微積分，但如果有修過大多會知道高等微積分的存在，解決很多微積分基礎課程中很難解決的問題（例如：隱函數定理）。同理，上完老師的刑法總則就會感受到有「高等刑法學」的存在，知道還有太多理論在基礎課程沒有辦法提及，諸如：「共犯関係からの離脱」、「錯誤論：故意の個数について」等等。會覺得上老師的課很新奇（雖然有的時候很挫折），畢竟臺灣的教科書只寫兩段帶過的東西，佐伯老師跟橋爪老師的書大概都寫三十幾頁。總而言之真的受益良多，希望未來能繼續跟著老師學習。,"Let's put it this way, although most law departments have not studied calculus, if they have, most of them will know the existence of advanced calculus, and solve many difficult problems in basic calculus courses (for example: implicit function theorem). In the same way, after completing the teacher's general principles of criminal law, you will feel the existence of ""advanced criminal law"", and know that there are too many theories that cannot be mentioned in basic courses, such as: ""Accomplice relationship からの解运"", ""Error theory: Deliberately の number について"" and so on. I feel that taking the teacher's class is very novel (although sometimes it is very frustrating). After all, Taiwan's textbooks only write about two paragraphs. The books of Mr. Saeki and Mr. Hashizume are about 30 pages long.

630cf1c940e337e60fce2996,老師的產業知識十分豐富，在加上含括多種產業面向的個案，在這堂課可以增加很多很扎實的產業知識，同時，在分析個案時也會常常使用策略分析的架構，幫助我記憶並應用理論架構。 上課時老師會隨機抽問，我蠻喜歡這種上課方式的，一方面增加自己的專心程度，一方面在被點到時逼自己快速反應。 總體而言，很推薦大家來修~,"The teacher's industry knowledge is very rich. In addition to the cases that include various industries, I can add a lot of solid industry knowledge in this class. At the same time, I often use the framework of strategic analysis when analyzing cases, which helps me remember and Applied theoretical framework.

630cf1c940e337e60fce2a25,老師上課很有條理，偶爾還會分享有趣的小故事給我們，很喜歡老師上課的風格。不過期中考滿分超越 100，只要超過就只能算 100，覺得有一些不公平（不過老師都有提早講清楚），也許未來可以調整這個配分規定～最後，還是很感謝老師的用心教學，辛苦了！,"The teacher is very organized in class, and occasionally shares interesting stories with us. I really like the style of the teacher's class. However, the full score of the midterm exam exceeds 100. As long as it exceeds 100, it can only be counted as 100.

The teacher takes everyone to learn about mythology from multiple perspectives, and will design a lot of interesting small activities. I look forward to class every time! I really like listening to the teacher share his relevant experiences and attitudes towards life, etc. Wait, I hope that I can also be like a teacher, a person who learns in many ways, is full of enthusiasm and never slackens.

630cf1c840e337e60fce28df,士軒老師在上課上都會舉很多的例子加上作圖讓我們更能了解抽象的刑法概念，然後老師除了板書以外還會有課程大綱、補充教材等多元的課後補充，認真學習的話真的能把刑法學的很紮實。然後老師在每次課後還會寄信補充講解的內容、考前的叮嚀和建議也是很暖心，能感受到老師很關心學生。唯期末範圍太大，課程影片也很多（有些聲音偏小板書字也很小上的有點吃力），讓期末的時候負擔蠻大的，讓也可能是自己太晚開始讀的問題。總之很幸運能修的這門課，也謝謝老師和助教的用心和付出！,"Teacher Shixuan will give a lot of examples and draw pictures in the class so that we can better understand the abstract concept of criminal law.

Then the teacher will send a letter after each class to supplement the content of the explanation, and the exhortations and suggestions before the exam are also very heartwarming, and I can feel that the teacher cares about the students. However, the scope of the final period is too large, and there are many course videos (some of the voices are too small and the writing on the blackboard is too small, which makes it a bit difficult to read), which makes the burden of the final period quite heavy, and it may also be a problem that I started reading too late.

630cf1c840e337e60fce297b,因為是文學課的關係，或許可以試試看規定學生在課前閱讀文本，減少課上由老師進行翻譯的時間。節省的時間可以用來進行文學理論的教學。政大的學生必修國文課，因此應不會對文學理論感到牴觸。因為是大三專業課程的關係，對寫作的深度和廣度應該都能加強。否則現行上課模式近似於自行上網找文本中譯。實屬可惜。再者，修課人數少或許可以發展成ゼミ的上課模式。謝謝老師。,"Because it is a literature class, maybe you can try to require students to read the text before class, so as to reduce the time for the teacher to translate in class. The time saved can be used to teach literary theory. National Chengchi University students are required to take Chinese courses, so they should not feel conflicted about literary theory. Because it is a junior professional course, the depth and breadth of writing should be strengthened. Otherwise, the current teaching mode is similar to looking for Chinese translations of texts online. It's a pity. Furthermore, the small number of students may be able to develop into a ゼミ class mode. Thank you, teacher.",1065,639,0,2,0.005539059638977051

630cf1c940e337e60fce29b1,建議老師可以先行安排考試座位，並於考試時間積極監督考試、考卷由老師或助教批改，避免作弊情事層出不窮，同學間互相批改考卷也有失公平。 考古題與小考題目重疊範圍過多，上課內容和考試內容相關性不高，以致同學出席意願不高。,"It is suggested that the teacher can arrange the test seats in advance, and actively supervise the test during the test time. The test papers are marked by teachers or teaching assistants to avoid cheating and it is unfair for students to correct each other's test papers. There is too much overlap between the archeology questions and quiz questions, and the correlation between the class content and the test content is not high, so that students are not willing to attend.",112,658,0,1,0.0003960728645324707

The teacher's handling of the course and the way of the exam are almost perfect. It is a good class that can really learn a lot of knowledge.

630cf1c840e337e60fce290c,謝謝老師。 可能是因為學期課時間相對較趕的關係，加上個體經濟學本身的理解有難度，即使每周都有投入非常多時間，還是沒有辦法反映在考試的成績上，不好意思......,"Thank you, teacher. It may be due to the relatively short schedule of the semester, and the difficulty in understanding individual economics itself. Even if a lot of time is invested every week, there is still no way to reflect it on the test results. Sorry... .",239,766,0,3,0.0003643035888671875
630cf1c840e337e60fce28c1,與上學期的授課方式差異頗大，銜接上因老師授課強調的重點不同，進而影響知識接受方式和期中期末作答方式。關於授課可以感受到老師非常用心投入，和老師自己關注的焦點，但授課進度可以快一點（基礎概念有些時候會花很多時間），導致較進階的部分只能大致帶過，也希望老師可以加深授課難度，並且多講授學說爭議及批判。期中期末作答方式則因為上學期學習的作答方式不同，希望老師能提前講清楚看重的作答內容，才不會學生用心準備，卻因老師批改重點不同結果得分很低。但還是很感謝老師很用心的授課！,"The teaching method of the previous semester is quite different from the teaching method of the previous semester. In terms of connection, the emphasis of the teacher's teaching is different, which in turn affects the way of knowledge acceptance and the way of answering at the end of the semester. Regarding the teaching, I can feel that the teacher is very devoted and the focus of the teacher's own attention, but the progress of the teaching can be a little faster (sometimes the basic concepts will take a lot of time), so the more advanced parts can only be roughly covered. I also hope that the teacher can Increase the difficulty of teaching, and more lectures on theoretical controversy and criticism. The way of answering at the end of the mid-term is different from the way of answering in the last semester. I hope the teacher can clearly explain the important answer content in advance, so that the students will not prepare carefully, but the result is very low due to the different emphasis of the teacher's correction. But I am still very grateful to the teacher for his hard work in teaching!",873,762,0,1,0.059899091720581055
630cf1c840e337e60fce28d4,老師期中考前銜接上學期銜接有點過久，期中考後新的東西都塞在一起，導致期末考準備有點吃力，但老師案例都講的很仔細，受益良多，謝謝老師,"It took too long for the teacher to link up with the last semester before the midterm exam.

630cf1c940e337e60fce29cc,有一些單位在排班上會傾向讓實習生只在早上或只在下午排班，但直到選課系統關閉後才得知想去的單位有這個偏好，對我們來說就沒有調整的空間了，因此如果實際操作可行的話，建議老師可以把單位媒合的時間往前調整一點，在選課結束前就連絡上單位的話，可以更好安排自己的課表與上班時間，也更容易達成課堂要求的100小時，謝謝。,"Some units tend to schedule interns only in the morning or only in the afternoon, but we don’t know that the unit we want to go to has this preference until the course selection system is closed. For us, there is no room for adjustment. Therefore, if the actual operation is feasible, it is suggested that the teacher can adjust the matchmaking time of the unit a little earlier.

I can learn a lot from the teacher.

630cf1c940e337e60fce2a57,課程目標也點零散，可能跟元宇宙本身還不是非常普及及明朗有關，但是焦點有點模糊。,"The objectives of the course are also scattered, which may be related to the fact that the metaverse itself is not very popular and clear, but the focus is a bit vague.",1082,770,0,2,0.0003345012664794922
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a55,找來的校外講師也太容易離題了,The off-campus lecturers I found are too easy to digress,1082,770,0,2,0.0008066296577453613

630cf1c940e337e60fce2a81,週五早8體育課是個運動的好時間，老師都很有元氣的帶操教動作，指令都給得很清晰。是堂負擔適中的課程。,"The physical education class at 8 am on Friday is a good time for exercise. The teachers are very energetic and teach the movements, and the instructions are very clear. It is a course with a moderate burden.",758,670,0,1,0.9854890704154968
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a5a,原先看到課程名稱後對本課產生興趣，但受課後發現除了部分講座講者專業領域涉及元宇宙外，教授本身對此主題研究深度甚淺，上課內容仍然環繞教授原先的研究專業。多元整合專業知識的概念很棒，但建議可適度調配其比例，不然會有種被課程名稱騙來修課的感覺，供參。,"Originally, I became interested in this course after seeing the title of the course, but after taking the course, I found that except for some lecturers whose professional fields were related to the metaverse, the professor himself did not have a deep research on this topic, and the content of the class still revolved around the professor's original research field. The concept of multi-integrated professional knowledge is great, but it is recommended to adjust its proportion appropriately, otherwise there will be a feeling of being deceived by the name of the course to take the course, for reference.",1082,770,0,2,0.03486788272857666
630cf1c940e337e60fce2b14,很有趣的一堂課,very interesting class,753,661,0,1,0.9998321533203125

630cf1c940e337e60fce2a3d,我覺得目前都很棒 希望老師繼續保持,"I think everything is great so far, I hope the teacher will continue to maintain it",753,661,0,1,0.9998576641082764
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a8d,這門課不管老師還是助教都非常用心，老師跟助教回覆訊息的速度快到我真的嚇到，十分感謝老師跟助教們這一學年的教導。,Both the teacher and the teaching assistants are very attentive in this course. The speed of the teachers and teaching assistants replying to messages is so fast that I am really shocked. I am very grateful to the teachers and teaching assistants for their guidance this school year.,764,650,3,1,0.9995511174201965
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a90,老師講解的很清楚，也會在上課時帶著我們一個個操作各分錄應該怎麼寫。,"The teacher explained it very clearly, and he also showed us how to write each entry one by one during the class.",764,650,3,1,0.9994016885757446
630cf1c940e337e60fce2ad2,老師授課口條組織非常明確，以組別輪流報告與老師講授雙軌的課程進行模式，兩種學習模式都能從中吸收,"The organization of the teacher's lectures is very clear, and the two-track course mode of the group taking turns to report and the teacher's lectures can be absorbed by the two learning modes",1081,769,0,1,0.01712179183959961
630cf1c940e337e60fce2ad3,雖然這堂課真的蠻硬的XD 但老師的講述很有趣，可以學到很多東西，也可以看見許多不同的觀點，非常喜歡黃老師的中國大陸研究！,"Although this class is really hard XD, but the teacher's narration is very interesting, you can learn a lot, and you can also see many different points of view. I really like Teacher Huang's research on mainland China!",1081,769,0,1,0.9995508790016174
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a8b,有時候檢討課後作業的時間會壓縮到上正課的時間，導致考試範圍要調整。其他都很讚！老師很用心上課,"Sometimes the time for reviewing homework will be reduced to the time for class, resulting in adjustments to the scope of the exam. Everything else is great! The teacher is very attentive in class",764,650,3,1,0.9997925162315369
630cf1c940e337e60fce2ad8,老師授課內容真的很扎實!而且教學內容進度規畫很有條理! 還是比較喜歡上老師的實體課...,The content of the teacher's lectures is really solid! And the schedule of the teaching content is very organized! I still prefer to take the teacher's physical class...,1081,769,0,1,0.9998273253440857

630cf1c940e337e60fce2b16,雖然扯鈴的考試只有一次機會壓力有點大，但老師人很好，問問題也都會細心講解！,"Although there is only one chance to take the diabolo test, the pressure is a bit high, but the teacher is very nice and will explain carefully when asked!",753,661,0,1,0.9994778037071228
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a9c,畫質可以再注意，如果是在實體教室錄影的話,"You can pay more attention to the picture quality, if it is recorded in a physical classroom",239,675,0,1,0.0028028488159179688
630cf1c940e337e60fce2ab0,這門課融合小組報告、課後心得及辯論的教學方式我覺得很新鮮，美中不足的是覺得教材可以適時更新，例如陳文茜的正負二度C真的很舊了，花了整節課在看卻有種地球暖化也沒像她說的那麼嚴重的感覺,"I think the teaching method of this course integrating group reports, after-class experience and debate is very fresh. The fly in the ointment is that the teaching materials can be updated in a timely manner. For example, Chen Wenqian's plus or minus two degrees C is really old. I spent the whole class looking at it There is a feeling that global warming is not as serious as she said",32,667,0,1,0.0779687762260437
630cf1c940e337e60fce2aeb,希望老師能在課堂中講解作業的內容及要求，不要每次到了下課之後才說下禮拜要報告，但我們卻完全沒有方向。,"I hope that the teacher can explain the content and requirements of the homework in class, and don't just say that we will report next week after class, but we have no direction at all.",32,667,0,1,0.0004470944404602051
630cf1c940e337e60fce2ad0,有各組時事的報告讓我們更加了解中國 老師也很溫柔,"There are reports on current events in various groups, which let us know more about China. The teacher is also very gentle.",1081,769,0,1,0.9996033310890198
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a58,老師跟學生關係良好，作業及報告負擔不重。雖然是新開的課，但講座有點多，講者也不見得都很熟元宇宙這塊，有點可惜。,"Teachers have a good relationship with students, and the burden of homework and reports is not heavy. Although it is a new class, there are a lot of lectures, and the speakers may not be very familiar with the Metaverse, which is a pity.",1082,770,0,2,0.5521858930587769
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a59,可以了解最近很紅的元宇宙相關的議題，對元宇宙有初步認識,"You can learn about the recently popular issues related to the metaverse, and have a preliminary understanding of the metaverse",1082,770,0,2,0.999064028263092
630cf1c940e337e60fce2b17,每一次去上課基本上只會有一次考試機會，到了隔周又要重新抓手感，感覺課堂人數有點太多,"Every time I go to class, there is basically only one chance to take the exam, and I have to start again every other week. I feel that the number of people in the class is a bit too much",753,661,0,1,0.00024121999740600586
630cf1c940e337e60fce2ab1,老師鼓勵學生思考，並且給予我們很多小組討論的時間，同學間的討論帶來對這堂課更多的認知，謝謝老師,The teacher encouraged the students to think and gave us a lot of time for group discussions. The discussions among the students brought more understanding of this class. Thank you teacher,32,667,0,1,0.9996980428695679

630cf1c940e337e60fce2a98,老師人很好，但我覺得這學期3次段考+3次小考+期末報告+每周作業的負擔有點太重了,"The teacher is very nice, but I think the burden of 3 section exams + 3 quiz + final report + weekly homework this semester is a bit too heavy",764,650,3,1,0.0007668733596801758
630cf1c940e337e60fce2ad6,老師超級棒 這學期最喜歡的課,"The teacher is amazing, favorite class this semester",1081,769,0,1,0.9998692274093628

630cf1c940e337e60fce2a8f,老師教的很棒！不過主要還是希望ETP的課程可以由英語口說比較流暢的老師來擔任授課老師，老師的細心教學在中文授課的課堂學生的吸收效果可能會有顯著提升。,"The teacher taught great! However, I mainly hope that the ETP courses can be taught by teachers who are relatively fluent in oral English. The teacher's careful teaching may significantly improve the absorption effect of students in the Chinese-taught classroom.",764,650,3,1,0.9935500025749207

630cf1c940e337e60fce2a88,不建議英文授課，難以理解，大家都依賴助教影片。小考、期中考的次數蠻多的有點硬,"It is not recommended to teach in English, it is difficult to understand, and everyone relies on teaching assistant videos. There are quite a lot of quizzes and mid-term exams, which are a bit hard",764,650,3,1,0.0007477402687072754
630cf1c940e337e60fce2acf,老師教得很好，我很喜歡! 也讓原本對中國大陸不了解的地方清楚了解了,"The teacher taught very well, I like it very much! It also made it clear what I didn't know about mainland China",1081,769,0,1,0.99981290102005
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a94,覺得老師在課程進度方面可以再稍微慢一點，有些較難的地方有點難以消化。這學期增加的報告其實還不錯，有實際應用到會計方面的知識!,"I feel that the teacher can slow down a little bit in terms of course progress, and some difficult parts are a bit difficult to digest. The report added in this semester is actually pretty good, with practical knowledge applied to accounting!",764,650,3,1,0.9989442229270935
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a39,老師在上課的時候都會走來走去看我們有什麼問題，如果我們有不會的老師都很樂意再做一遍給我們看,"The teacher will walk around to see if we have any problems during the class. If we have teachers who don’t know how to do it, they will be happy to do it again for us to see.",753,661,0,1,0.9981555342674255

630cf1c940e337e60fce2a86,建議上下學期可以平均分配課程，這學期最後的期末報告是一個大作業。,"It is suggested that courses can be evenly distributed between the two semesters, and the final report at the end of this semester is a big homework.",764,650,3,1,0.03383821249008179
630cf1c940e337e60fce2acd,老師講課很清楚！期中期末開書考還鼓勵同學討論，會讓知識從負荷變成一件有趣的事，真的能學到很多東西而不是一堂囫圇吞棗的必修課！,"The teacher lectures very clearly! The open book exam at the end of the term also encourages students to discuss, which will turn knowledge from a load into an interesting thing, and you can really learn a lot instead of a compulsory course swallowed!",1081,769,0,1,0.9993133544921875
630cf1c940e337e60fce2adb,老師十分用心，每週上課內容都很豐富，覺得收穫滿滿。同時老師也會給每週的小組報告建議與回饋，讓同學清楚地知道自己有什麼可以進步的地方，也因此學到了很多。謝謝老師！,"The teacher is very attentive, and the content of the class every week is very rich, and I feel that I have gained a lot. At the same time, the teacher will also give suggestions and feedback to the weekly group reports, so that students can clearly know where they can improve, and learn a lot from it. Thank you, teacher!",1081,769,0,1,0.9998493194580078
630cf1c940e337e60fce2ae1,謝謝老師很有組織性的課程講解讓人對於中國的體制及社會有了更多想像，覺得獲益良多,"Thank you, teacher, for the well-organized course explanations, which made people have more imaginations about China's system and society, and felt that they benefited a lot.",1081,769,0,1,0.9998201727867126

630cf1c940e337e60fce29d1,希望老師能針對財務數學多教一些精算考試相關知識，期末做的報告不一定要三個禮拜的報告，相信大家都能做出符合要求的內容，也希望報告要求一開始就能說清楚。,I hope that the teacher can teach more knowledge about actuarial exams on financial mathematics. The report at the end of the semester does not necessarily have to be a three-week report.,1064,664,0,3,0.6759746074676514

630cf1c940e337e60fce2ada,這堂課讓我更了解中共政府的運作方式、想法，雖然很多專有名詞都會搞混(長得超像)，但讀起來其實蠻有趣的。另方面也更了解中國會茁壯成今日的世界大國真的是有它的道理在。如果因為「討厭中國、討厭中共」，而選擇忽略、不去了解事實、背後成因，真的很可惜。,"This class gave me a better understanding of the way the CCP government operates and its thinking. Although many proper nouns are confusing (they look super similar), it is actually quite interesting to read. On the other hand, I also understand that there is a reason why China will thrive as a world power today. It is really a pity if you choose to ignore and not understand the facts and the reasons behind it because you ""hate China and the CCP"".",1081,769,0,1,0.9930612444877625
630cf1c940e337e60fce2a7c,我認為老師對於初學者非常有耐心，像我每次課後經常有不懂的動作，老師都會非常有耐心的一一地教導，這也是讓我非常喜歡這堂課課的一點,"I think the teacher is very patient with beginners. For example, every time I often have movements that I don’t understand after class, the teacher will teach them one by one very patiently.

630cf1c940e337e60fce2a3a,不推薦零基礎的同學修課。因為這門課通常都有部分同學已精熟（扯鈴、跳繩，本學期因為遠距沒有上陀螺），因此在需要評分的情況下，儘管老師會重頭教，但是與練過的同學相比，還會有一段不小的落差，造成分數的差距，需要自己調適挫折感,"It is not recommended for students with zero foundation to take courses. Because some students are usually proficient in this course (diabells, skipping rope, this semester did not take the top because of the distance), so when grading is required, although the teacher will teach it again, compared with the students who have practiced , there will still be a big gap, resulting in a gap in scores, and you need to adjust your frustration",753,661,0,1,0.0006299614906311035

He will observe the situation of the students and adjust the teaching content and speed. When the students respond to the situation, they will improve immediately.

630cf1c940e337e60fce2a92,雖然是英語授課，但英文不好的同學可以不用擔心，老師講得比較慢，重要的點也會用中文再解釋一遍，老師人也很好下課都可以去問問題！,"Although the class is taught in English, students who are not good at English don’t have to worry. The teacher speaks slowly, and the important points will be explained again in Chinese. The teacher is also very kind and you can ask questions after class!",764,650,3,1,0.9986026883125305

I hope the teacher can demonstrate some sample questions in the exam.",239,675,0,1,0.016306698322296143
630cf1c940e337e60fce2ab2,希望老師可以減少遲到的狀況，一點十分開始的課，有幾堂都遲到半小時四十分鐘才來。,"I hope the teacher can reduce the situation of being late. For the classes that start at 1:10, there are several classes that are half an hour and forty minutes late.",32,667,0,1,0.003958940505981445

630cf1c940e337e60fce2b15,扯鈴部分需要記憶和平衡比較困難，如果不是手眼很協調的人可能會需要額外花時間練習。全部課程中，只有跳繩那幾週比較花體力，想要上有趣的體育課又不想太累的話很適合這門課程！,"The diabolo part requires memorization and balance is more difficult, and people who are not very hand-eye coordination may need to spend extra time practicing.

630cf1c940e337e60fce2b13,老師對於課程安排有很好的規劃，上課認真。也很樂於幫助學生、提供小技巧學會動作。但進度對於運動神經不太好的我來說還是快了點，每週的小測驗會有點壓力。,"The teacher has a good plan for the curriculum arrangement, and the class is serious. I am also very happy to help students and provide tips to learn movements.

630cf1c940e337e60fce2aa7,老師的評分方式實在太佛心了，老師也很常補充一些實證的研究，對於自己整個學年個經的學習成效有非常大的幫助，教學能深入淺出，可以很容易就聽的懂課程的內容!,"The teacher's grading method is really Buddha-minded, and the teacher often adds some empirical research, which is very helpful to my learning effect of the whole school year.

630cf1c940e337e60fce2aea,希望老師可以在每次作業或是報告之前，可以多利用上課時間說明清楚標準及方向，而不是到最後快要下課才開始匆促的說明作業規定！,"I hope that the teacher can make more use of class time to clarify the standards and directions before each assignment or report, instead of rushing to explain the assignment rules at the end of class!",32,667,0,1,0.019684255123138428

630cf1c940e337e60fce2a97,希望老師未來能開中文授課的班級，因為英文授課的效果沒有中文來的好，老師教學認真，謝謝老師總是耐心地回答我們各式各樣的問題，也會在每堂下課有練習題讓我們更加熟練會計題目，再次感謝老師的用心教學,"I hope that the teacher can teach Chinese classes in the future, because the effect of English teaching is not as good as that of Chinese.

630cf1c940e337e60fce2ad4,細節的部分要課前課後自己研讀，老師上課會很有架構的連結各個知識點，整體而言很充實。另外，老師對於報告時間很有原則，這點我覺得可以視為對自己知識濃縮和時間掌握的訓練。,"The details should be studied by yourself before and after class. The teacher will connect each knowledge point in a structured way in class, which is very fulfilling as a whole.

630cf1c940e337e60fce29c2,因為系上有點太早教後面考試範圍，導致第二次期中前老師上完課後，沒餘力再複習上課內容（期末考範圍）。等考完第二次期中要複習期末考範圍時，要花更多心力及時間準備。但老師很樂意幫我們解決問題，很謝謝老師！,"Because the department taught the scope of the later exam a little too early, the former teacher had no time to review the content of the class (the scope of the final exam) after the second midterm.
